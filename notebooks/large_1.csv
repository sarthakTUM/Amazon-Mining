To differentiate it from the competition, the Monster designer have colored theirs a shade of purple and have labeled the 9 outlets with multi-colored, not very useful but harmless plastic tags such as VCR (really?), CD, Receiver, CATV and so forth. There is also a master on-off button that shines a blue light when on.So far, so good but then there is an inexcusable design flaw. This works well for as long as you are using 2- or 3-prong plugs. Whether they are for the VCR, the CD or your CATV, they fit well on this unit's side. The trouble comes when you try to plug in just about any AD/DC adapter because this unit's design does not allow it or makes it extremely difficult and inconvenient. This is bad. In addition, the provided patch coax cable is short enough to make it useless - of course you can get something of a more useful length at the store but why bother to include one if it's only 3-4 ft. long?To summarize: you get surge protection for up to 9 devices if they are all using 2- or 3-prong plugs and coax if a 3-ft. long patch cable is long enough. The labels are largely useless because they are somewhat obsolete (VCR, CD) but they don't hurt. The blue light emitted by the on button can serve as a night light.I am okay with my purchase because I acquired mine as an Amazon's lightning deal deep discount but you can probably get 'better' from a more established power surge equipment vendor even at the currently advertised price.","[0, 0]",Some like it purple,2011,11, 4,,1766,320,Negative,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20111104

It is USB 2.0 certified, meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and, if your device accepts a Mini-B plug, this is the cable to get.

However, I suggest that you look around before you place the order because you just might have one of these already as they tend to ship with many electronic gadgets these days.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need.Whenever in doubt, do some more research and keep in mind that the 'Micro-B' (very small) is the emerging standard and it's likely to be found on the newer and smaller gadgets - phones, cameras, etc. but, before it we had the 'Mini-B' (this specific cable) so the older devices will need the 'Mini'.","[184, 187]",It's a good cable but make sure that THIS is what you need,2009,08, 19,0.983957219251337,2219,394,Positive,184,187,3,0.028301579547305,20090819

FUD is a manifestation of the appeal to fear.""Still Wikipedia, quoting Eric S. Raymond: ""The idea, of course, was to persuade buyers to go with safe [...] gear rather than with competitors' equipment. This implicit coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would happen to people who stuck with [...], but Dark Shadows loomed over the future of competitors' equipment [...]"".HDMI is all-digital for both sound and picture. As such, it either works or it doesn't and, when it doesn't work, you will know immediately. There's really nothing in-between. If a claim is made that the Monster is 'more reliable' or that it 'lasts longer', I can't see how such claim can be backed - does the hundred-dollar cable last 20 times longer than than the five-dollar cable? And, if it does, do we REALLY care that a cable supporting a standard that may be obsolete in 5 years COULD last for 100 years?By the way, I do not challenge the claim of high quality for this cable. It appears to be well built. However, it is quality not needed and, in my view, not worth paying for. The way most of us use cables is: we plug them at the back of our electronic boxes and, if they work on 'day one' they are likely to work in the exact same fashion on day 1000 because they are not going to be subjected to any physical or thermal stress and the materials used to build them are not easily degradable. While 'quality' was important for analog cables where good quality made all the difference in the world, the digital wires either transmit the digits or they don't. If they do, they all work the same, the $1 HDMI cable gives you the exact same 'performance' the $100, gold-plated cable does.The claims that seem to suggest that these expensive wires allow more Gigabytes of data to pass through and the implied suggestion that you would get a less bright image or a less crisp sound if you used a two-dollar cable are NOT true. The HDMI is a published standard and there is a minimum data throughput that must be supported. If it is, then the device is HDMI compliant and you will get everything that HDMI promises to deliver. If some cable exceeds the specified throughput, it's nice but it's irrelevant because no electronic component that's HDMI compliant would attempt to push more bytes through the wire than the standard specifies. If they did, they'd violate the specs and would not sell very well. If your electronic component had an HDMI port that called for an HDMI cable that exceeded the HDMI published standards, then it would no longer be called an HDMI port but a proprietary, non-standard solution.The following are the HDMI 1.3 specs and ALL certified HDMI 1.3 cables (including the five-dollar wires and the Monster) are going to support them. Whatever 'extra' the M Series offers is useless because no HDMI-connected hardware component is going to ask for more.Maximum signal bandwidth (MHz) 340Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s) 10.2Maximum video bandwidth (Gbit/s) 8.16Maximum audio bandwidth (Mbit/s) 36.86Maximum Color Depth (bit/px) 48Maximum resolution over single link at 24-bit/px  25601600p75Maximum resolution over single link at 30-bit/px  25601600p60Maximum resolution over single link at 36-bit/px  1920x1200p75Maximum resolution over single link at 48-bit/px  19201200p60sRGBYCbCr8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio capabilityBlu-ray Disc video and audio at full resolutionConsumer Electronic Control (CEC)DVD-Audio supportSuper Audio CD (DSD) supportDeep ColorxvYCCAuto lip-syncDolby TrueHD bitstream capableDTS-HD Master Audio bitstream capableUpdated list of CEC commands (only on HDMI 1.3a,b,c)My suggestion: search Amazon for ""hdmi cable 1.3"" and make an informed price/quality decision before you buy._____________________________________NOTE 1: I noticed a typical FUD statement that has been posted on this page in the form of a video. The presenter suggests that all signals, including 'digital' get degraded when passing through a wire because of the 'laws of physics'. The key word in his presentation is that 'IF YOU HAVE A REALLY LONG CABLE' then you may get into trouble. This is true. You can't have a 100 ft. HDMI cable or a one mile-long cable. Eventually, unless your signal, digital or analog, is boosted in some way, it's going to die and you won't be able to decode it at the other end.However, this is NOT the point. This HDMI cable is NOT 'really long'. In fact, it is REALLY SHORT and, no matter how much FUD is inserted into the discussion, on 6 ft. or 8 ft. cables, you are NOT going to get a 'better' picture just because you pay 100 times more for a wire.Unless the vendor comes up with some unbiased tests showing that, on 6 ft. or on 8 ft. cables the less expensive brands loses 'bits' to the degree that the receiving device can't correct for the loss while the expensive brand does not, this is nothing but FUD.NOTE 2: All of the above applies to the 2-meter cable. When ordering the 4-meter and especially the 6-meter lengths, I would make sure that the cable is certified as ""HDMI Category 2"" or ""High-Speed"" FOR THAT SPECIFIC LENGTH.","[0, 0]",FUD - a perfect example (applies to the 2-meter cable),2009,07, 7,,5288,878,Negative,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20090707

The claim is that, if you do this, you won't have to take your laptop out of the case and, therefore, if you buy this case you buy some convenience. The sad reality is that I was always asked to take my laptop out of the case at airport security points and, most of the time, I was asked to actually turn it on. In two instances, the airport detectives actually took my laptop and inserted it inside a machine supposedly capable to detect minute traces of certain substances so, Zip-Thru doesn't do much, given the current airport security practices and circumstances. I can't see any good use for this feature.The so-called life-time warranty seems to be nothing else but a promise to replace the bag if found defective - ""if after inspection we find that the product was defective in materials or workmanship"". This is nice but it would be illegal not to. Amazon would take back a defective product anyway so the 'lifetime warranty' doesn't mean much.Overall, I will grant this product 4 stars (it's 3.5 rounded up).

Any HDMI 1.3 cable can carry up to 10.2 Gbit/s. Hmmm... I suppose the Monster is much better, right?

Given that I had used this model on a rental car in the past, I knew what I was going to get and I made an informed decision to buy a feature-poor but relatively inexpensive device.This is what the c330 has going for it:- As far as I can tell, it is very accurate. It always takes me to the destination, I never got lost or ended up somewhere else and I never found myself driving lots of extra miles by following the directions.- It's inexpensive.- It's easy to set up.- The voice directions are loud and clear and the screen, while small, it's easy to view and read.- It quickly recalculates your route once you stray off the recommended path.- The basic package has all that you need if your needs are 'basic'.The following are some issues I have with the c330:- No flexibility in modifying the recommended route other than the ability to add ONE (and only one) stop.- The support web site and the available firmware upgrades is worthless. The upgrades are posted but I have no idea what they exactly are for and the warnings and disclaimers are so strong, they scared me away from proceeding with any.- The menus are not the friendliest.- The device seems to keep track of all kinds of things, including the maximum speed since the last reset. I'm not sure I would want to have that if a cop ever stopped me and the stats were displayed in plain view and I don't know a way to prevent it from collecting these stats.- The display shows 'expected time of arrival' but there's no ability to, maybe, show 'miles to destination' instead. In fact, I don't believe there is an easy way to figure out how many miles you are going to drive.- The c330 decides how to take you there and there is no way to give it some parameters as 'shortest route' or 'favor highways'. It seems to do what appears to be 'reasonable' - favors highways to back roads, which is okay but, again, it is not too flexible.- Can't hold a specific zoom level. As soon as enter or a highway or cross a main road, it zooms in and it never gets back to the zoom level you set it initially. This can be quite annoying.- On a bumpy road, sometimes the display turns blue and it claims that it just lost power from the source and wants you to confirm it using the batteries or it shuts down. If you don't confirm, it shuts itself down even though it's quite apparent that it only lost power for a fraction of a second as you were going over the bump.Given the above, I am happy with this device because the main reason I bought it is to get me to unfamiliar destinations and to get me home or to work when I run into strange and unusual 'detour' situations. I will buy a device with more features in a couple of years when I can get more features for the amount I paid for the c330 today.","[3, 3]",Meets basic needs - my '4 stars' review could mean '2 stars' to you,2007,09, 2,1.0,2806,532,Positive,3,3,0,0.022504478098029638,20070902

But, let me talk about the Harmony.You get:- the remote- the charger/stand- a rechargeable battery that goes inside the remote- a power adapter that plugs into the electrical outlet- a USB wire- a setup CD- a very basic 'paper' manualYou need:- an Internet-connected computer with an USB port and a CD driveThe setup preparation:- you insert the battery into the remote body- you connect the power adapter to the stand- you place the remote on the stand and wait for the battery to charge- you connect the remote to the computer through the USB wire- you insert the CD into the computer's CD driveThe initial remote configuration:- you agree to the license terms- you provide some information such as your name and email address- you open an account with Logitech (password is optional)- the setup utility updates the remote with the latest and greatestSetting up devices:You are asked to name the devices that you wish to control with the remote. It's best if you can provide the exact manufacturer, brand and model number. I did that for the first 3 devices I wanted to register and the setup utility was happy with the TV and the satellite receiver but, for some reason it did not recognize my little Bravia home theater. What followed was a series of interactions between the Bravia remote and the Harmony. I was asked to press certain buttons and, after a few minutes, the setup utility was able to recommend a close model.Setting up activities:Once I was done with the devices, the setup utility suggested some standard activities, such as 'watching TV' or 'watching a DVD'. For each activity, I had to answer some very specific questions having to do with the exact settings required for the TV, the Satellite receiver and the home theater device - I had to tell it which device changes the channels, which one controls the sound, which input are used by the TV and so on. Once all desired activities are configured, and up to 8 activities are possible, the computer updates the remote and you are ready to go.Some nice touches:- There is a page where the remote can be customized. You can actually upload a specific image for the background, you can select the way the time is displayed (time is updated from the computer). I even notice the ability to set up a slide show on the remote display.- The display turns itself off after a while (time for it to stay on is configurable) but it lights up as soon as you pick up the remote.- Most buttons that you are likely to need are already on the remote but the display makes up to eight 'soft buttons' available and they change depending of the context of your activities.Overall, I started skeptical but I am now impressed.My only regret is that blue-tooth is not supported so my PS3 can't be controlled but, even for the PS3, the remote will be quite useful, properly configuring the TV and the home theater.I recommend this device and, contrary to my initial inclination, it gets 5 stars.","[2, 2]","I started skeptical, I am now impressed",2008,10, 30,1.0,3525,617,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20081030

Believe it or not, a lot less that what you actually get if you buy Carson's Micro Max.What you get is a little, 2.25"" by 1.5"" body that holds the optics and 2 AAA batteries (not included). It has an on/off switch for the light, a 'zoom' dial to set magnification to anywhere between 60x and 100x and a 'focus' dial. To observe, after you set the desired zoom level and focus properly, you simply place the 'microscope' over whatever it is that you are studying. On a flat surface, it will stand on its own but you will probably have to hold it while fine-tuning the focus.To my surprise, you can see very well, the oblique, yellowish, incandescent lightbulb helps reveal the details of whatever it is you are looking at. Of course, this is the lowest end microscope you can think of and it's not always the easy to use. You can't prepare samples to observe and, since you are probably touching the body of the microscope while observing, you hold it very steady because every move you make will move the object of your study out of your observation area. But, let's not forget, this is an under-ten-dollar microscope that actually works.I bought this for my kids to help stimulate their curiosity and to encourage their exploratory/investigatory instincts. If they are truly interested in more deeply investigating the micro worlds, they will get something a lot better later.Briefly, what I like about this device was:- price - of course- ease of use - takes about 30 seconds to 'learn' it- solid built - it really seems to be quite durable- portability - you can carry it in your pocket, if you happen to be a kid out exploring- quality of imageThe not so good features would be:- requires steady hands to operate- it being recommended for 13 years or older - what's wrong with 10 year old using it?I am quite happy with this purchase.","[1, 1]","Cheap junk?

In fact it will outlast the T60 I've been using with ever since as the T60 will be replaced by a T400 in a couple of days - you won't need a new Mini-Dock as this one is fully compatible with the T400.To those unfamiliar with the ThinkPad style mini docks, this is as a minimalistic design as possible while adding to the 'port replicator' expectations by even adding a few extra ports - see below for features.- Small form factor.- Button for turning the laptop on/off or awaken it if it's plugged in while sleeping.- Laptop eject button.- Physical lock with physical keys to provide some security.- Will dock the laptop even when it's using the larger 9-cell battery.- Built in opening allowing for the hot air to exit via laptop's lwft side back vent.- Replicates and sometimes duplicates the following ports: serial, parallel (who's still using these?), VGA, round keyboard, DVI, phone line RJ-11, Ethernet RJ-45, microphone, headphones, USB.- Adds 4 USB ports to the existing 3 USBs on my laptop to give me a total of 7 (SEVEN) usable ports on my docked T60.I found this dock very easy to use and I found that it greatly simplifies my professional life.

In my work, we are doing a lot of video, audio conferencing using packages such as NetMeeting, SharedView, Communicator and son on. I, naively, assumed that a product making such a claim, would be easily set up in a way that allowed me to see what was going on in my living room while I was at work, on the road or on vacation. What follows, is my story.One clarification: I am not a geek, but I am not technologically dumb either. For example, I have some understanding of DHCP, DNS, IP, firewalls, routers and 802.11 but I'd rather not mess up with them.I did not encounter too many problems setting up the camera for local use/control. The manual on the disk is a .pdf file in English but I could not say that it was well-written. After about half an hour to one hour of installing the 2 software items and unnecessarily messing with my wireless router, the camera began sending some video to my computer. By the way, the manual seems to be incorrectly stating that you must connect through a wire to your wireless router and gives some very confusing and sometimes misleading advice on how to set up the camera's IP address. In my case, connecting the camera through a wire to my Linksys router PREVENTED the configuration utility to complete. The setup eventually completed but only AFTER I removed the wire.The pictures sent to the computer are of a poor quality - and I am a bit generous stating this. The maximum resolution is a poor 640x480. There is a noticeable delay, 1+ seconds in transmission, even when the camera is on a local loop. Control is possible but response is slow. The 'zoom' button does not do anything.One other problem seems to be the way this camera works with DHCP. Even though the camera has a unique MAC address, every time the router's DHCP assigns it a new IP address, the software thinks that it sees a new camera. What this means is that you may end up with an undetermined number of 'cameras' in the software interface running on your computer, all attempting to control the same device and you will have to guess which one is the one that actually can connect to the camera, every time you reset either your camera or your router.Now... to the ""access the camera from anywhere in the world"" part. It is VERY DIFFICULT to set it up because the vendor does not provide the software and the IP support needed and expects the end-user to go to 'third parties' for that - which is fine but is not mentioned in the 'product description', on the box or in the manuals that come with the camera. Like someone else who reviewed this device, I had to call the tech support. After some 10-15 minutes of elevator music, someone in India picked up the phone and asked for my phone number, email address, type of camera, date of birth, marital status, favorite food (just kidding). After she was satisfied with my answers she told me that someone was going to call me back later and she hung up. Someone never did. I called again and, to my surprise, the guy in India picked up the phone immediately. I wish I could say that he offered some competent advice, but he didn't. He did suggest that, to make the camera work over the Net, I had to open an account with some independent outfit that allows you to get a DNS name for your device and, therefore, at least in theory, be able to access the camera over the net. It's a cumbersome process and, in my case, it did not work very well. It involves getting and setting up a DNS name for your camera, punching holes into your firewall, regularly running some utility on your computer and updating your information on that site... too complicated and, in the end, not worth the effort.To be fair, I believe that this camera COULD be set up to be accessed and controlled over the Internet IF you could afford a dedicated, permanent IP address to it and you properly set up your router and firewall.The product gets 2 stars because someone COULD make it work. It's not a defective product. It's just very hard to make it do what it claims that it can do and the vendor's tech support or the provided documentation are not helping.I can see how a good market for this product would be those technical schools where the students learn how to set up and troubleshoot these things.I titled my review 'Incomplete' because of the several things missing in this package: a usable manual, competent technical support and support for a DNS name so that the camera can be accessed from the Web when a dedicated IP is not a practical option.","[0, 0]",Incomplete,2008,09, 5,,4652,844,Negative,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20080905

For reasons unknown, and I blame Sony, Vista could not read the CF card and claimed that the 'disc' had to be formatted. This is where this little device comes to the rescue. Once connected to my computer through a STANDARD USB cable (supplied) and once the CF card was inserted in the reader, I could copy back and forth without a problem. Case solved. Thank you whomever you people who make these readers, it was the best 'less than a dollar' investment I've ever made. And, shame on you, Sony. I will continue to love your products but in this specific case, you clearly dropped the ball.Here are specs:- Mini-B USB 2.0 interface- OS supported: Windows 98/2000/XP, Mac OS V9.2 or higher [Vista is not listed but it worked fine on my machine]- Cards supported: Compact Flash/Micro Drive/Smart, Media/Multimedia/Secure Digital Card/Memory Stick/Memory Stick PRO/xD Picture- Read speed 4.3 Mbps- Write speed 1.3 MbpsWhat you get (or not):- The card reader itself- 1-foot USB cable- Specs sheet- No manualThis is what I like about this product:- Excellent, almost amazing I/O performance. In a real-life benchmark, it copied 233MB (89 pictures) in 16 (sixteen) seconds. This was from a Kingston 16GB CompactFLASH 133X card card. I wish my camera was that quick reading the card.- The fact that, for less than one dollar (plus S&H;, of course) you even get a little USB wire.- The 'naked' or transparent styling of the case. Some may not appreciate the geekish look but I do.- Automatically recognized by Vista even though Vista wasn't even on the list of supported OSes.Issues and concerns:For the price, not too many but, here they are.- Must be careful when inserting the CF or MicroDrive cards. There are 'guides' that should help your card glide and insert itself into the proper pins but I can see how, if doing it in a hurry, you could bend the pins and then... you'll probably have to buy another one. The other 3 interfaces appear to be a little less fragile because they don't have pins.- I only tested the Compact Flash and the MicroDrive cards. I can't tell if the other interfaces work as well.- The red 'power on' LED showed me that the reader was properly interfacing with my computer but the LED that would have shown the CF card being in did not light up. It didn't make a difference to me but I don't know if this should be viewed as a defect or not.- I saw no warranty statement of any kind but... should I expect one on something this cheap?- I had no need to call for support and there is no support phone number anywhere but there IS a Web site which points to a directory tree whose branches are either locked up or empty. It's possible that the company is no longer in business and the reason we are getting this stuff this cheap is because it's post going out of business leftovers.Rating:Even considering the concerns I listed above, it gets 5 stars without hesitation.

FUD is a manifestation of the appeal to fear.""Still Wikipedia, quoting Eric S. Raymond: ""The idea, of course, was to persuade buyers to go with safe [...] gear rather than with competitors' equipment. This implicit coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would happen to people who stuck with [...], but Dark Shadows loomed over the future of competitors' equipment [...]"".Why would someone prefer a branded wire an not a more generic product that sells for a fraction of the price? I am sure that the marketing geniuses have the answer. In this specific case I am happy to see that this brand's pricing structure is coming closer to what most of the competition charges which is in the single-digits. The brand should make absolutely no difference on such short cable lengths if the cable actually works. This specific product is still selling at an unjustified (in my view) premium but I can understand that some would prefer a branded product even if it goes at the back of the box, never to be seen by anyone.HDMI is all-digital for both sound and picture. As such, it either works or it doesn't and, when it doesn't work, you will know immediately. There's really nothing in-between. If a claim is made that the Monster is 'more reliable' or that it 'lasts longer', I can't see how such claim can be backed - does the hundred-dollar cable last 20 times longer than than the five-dollar cable? And, if it does, do we REALLY care that a cable supporting a standard that may be obsolete in 5 years COULD last for 100 years?By the way, I do not challenge the claim of high quality for this cable. It appears to be well built. However, it is quality not needed and, in my view, not worth paying for. The way most of us use cables is: we plug them at the back of our electronic boxes and, if they work on 'day one' they are likely to work in the exact same fashion on day 1000 because they are not going to be subjected to any physical or thermal stress and the materials used to build them are not easily degradable. While 'quality' was important for analog cables where good quality made all the difference in the world, the digital wires either transmit the digits or they don't. If they do, they all work the same, the $1 HDMI cable gives you the exact same 'performance' the $100, gold-plated cable does.The claims that seem to suggest that these expensive wires allow more Gigabytes of data to pass through and the implied suggestion that you would get a less bright image or a less crisp sound if you used a two-dollar cable are NOT true. The HDMI is a published standard and there is a minimum data throughput that must be supported. If it is, then the device is HDMI compliant and you will get everything that HDMI promises to deliver. If some cable exceeds the specified throughput, it's nice but it's irrelevant because no electronic component that's HDMI compliant would attempt to push more bytes through the wire than the standard specifies. If they did, they'd violate the specs and would not sell very well. If your electronic component had an HDMI port that called for an HDMI cable that exceeded the HDMI published standards, then it would no longer be called an HDMI port but a proprietary, non-standard solution.The following are the HDMI 1.3 specs and ALL certified HDMI 1.3 cables (including the five-dollar wires and the Monster) are going to support them.

I am actually using 3 ft. cables whenever the connected devices happen to be very close to each other because, when it comes to cables, shorter is almost always better :).Just in case someone may feel guilty for not paying a lot more for a premium brand, it should be stated that at this lengths - 3-6 ft., you will get as good a service from a no-brand cable as you would from a super-expensive rip-off. An HDMI 1.3x cable should be able to carry, error free, all the signal your electronic equipment may put out. In fact, you can buy one or 2 extra 'cheap' cables, just in case. At this prices they're easily affordable.The FUD campaigns, trying to attract buyers toward the more expensive brands make a series of claims. I will address them, as they may apply to this specific cable.- Signal attenuation is less over a more expensive cable. - TRUE, BUT that's irrelevant on a 3-6 ft. length. The HDMI consortium stated that even the cables that were not 'certified' as 'Category 2' or 'High-Speed' will meet the requirements at lengths of 6 ft. or less.  At 3-6 ft., it would be a waste to consider an 'expensive' alternative. In addition, the newer devices have sufficient processing power and are sensitive enough to properly interpret even the more ambiguous 'digits' they receive. Incidentally, the vendor claims that this specific item WAS certified as 'category 2' and HDMI 1.3a.- The expensive cables are better engineered and their contacts are less likely to break. - TRUE, BUT how many times is one going to plug/unplug an HDMI cable in and out of an HDMI socket over the cable's lifetime? 5 times? 10 times? The 'better engineered' claim has no practical importance. If your cable works on 'day one' the odds are that it will be left in the back of your box for many months or years before it is unplugged and plugged back in. If this cable is purchased for home use, the 'better engineered' claim should not be of a major concern.- The more expensive cables are 'future proof'. - NOT TRUE. Claims are made that, if you buy the more expensive wires you won't have to buy new ones when 'new standards' emerge because the more expensive wire will support them. This is untrue on 2 different levels. First, your cheap cable was purchased to work with some very specific devices which need HDMI 1.3 and will never support the 'new standard'. The new standards will be supported by new electronic devices but, for as long as you keep the existing ones, you will still need this cable to connect them. Second, the emerging HDMI 1.4 specs call for new features such as an Ethernet channel and an audio return channel, both of which can't be supported by the existing HDMI 1.3 cables so, no matter how large a bandwidth the existing expensive cables may support, it won't matter because you still won't able to use them if you are to take full advantage of an HDMI 1.4 device so... there goes your $5 invesment or... your $200, depending on your having purchased a 'cheap' or a 'top of the line' HDMI cable.________________________________________Here are the HDMI 1.3 specs supported by both this cable and its more expensive alternatives.Maximum signal bandwidth (MHz) 340Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s) 10.2Maximum video bandwidth (Gbit/s) 8.16Maximum audio bandwidth (Mbit/s) 36.86Maximum Color Depth (bit/px) 48Maximum resolution over single link at 24-bit/px  25601600p75Maximum resolution over single link at 30-bit/px  25601600p60Maximum resolution over single link at 36-bit/px  1920x1200p75Maximum resolution over single link at 48-bit/px  19201200p60sRGBYCbCr8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio capabilityBlu-ray Disc video and audio at full resolutionConsumer Electronic Control (CEC)DVD-Audio supportSuper Audio CD (DSD) supportDeep ColorxvYCCAuto lip-syncDolby TrueHD bitstream capableDTS-HD Master Audio bitstream capableUpdated list of CEC commands (only on HDMI 1.3a,b,c)________________________________________My personal experience: I've never paid 'a lot' for an HDMI cable because it makes no sense to pay more.

It turns out that, all of the above, and more, are part of the HDMI 1.3 specs and they are fully supported by every cable that complies to the standard and can be had for about 95% less in the Premium Gold. The expensive brand presentation simply enumerates the HDMI 1.3 specs as if it being HDMI 1.3 compliant was a really big deal. It is not a big deal. Even a cable that costs 95% less is HDMI 1.3 compliant.My suggestion: if you think that the proponents of the expensive brand have a point when they claim that their product is a lot more durable, buy TWO Belkin wires or three and you still pay a fraction of what you would pay for one of the expensive ones.My personal experience: I've never paid 'a lot' for an HDMI cable because it makes no sense to pay more.

It will protect them against power surges and, in addition, it can protect one Ethernet/phone line (RJ-45) and one coax wire if they are connected to pass through the Belkin surge protector.My personal experience does validate the claims the manufacturer makes for the features that I am using and I can verify at this time. Currently, I have 9 devices plugged into the surge protector, including 5 DC adapters and 4 2/3-prong plugs. All of the 3 remaining slots are unobstructed and could be used for one additional power adapter and 2 more plugs.This surge protector replaces 2 older and smaller surge protectors and a one-to-six plug multiplier.So far, I am happy and, in my opinion and based on its meeting real needs, good design, features and low price I recommend it as (in my view) one of the best it its class.More details------------The following are noteworthy, in my view.Positives:+ TRUE 12-outlet capacity. Unlike the traditional surge-protected power strips where one beefy AC adapter would cover 2 slots, Belkin's device truly accommodates 6 AC adapters and allows for 6 more plugs to fit in.+ 'Protected' green light (must be on) provides assurance that the surge protector is operational. When the green light stays off it usually means that the surge protector 'expired' while protecting your device from a power surge and it must be replaced ASAP. [The Belkin warranty promises a free replacement under its warranty terms if you meet the requirements and, it seems, you pay for shipping the damaged unit to Belkin and, possibly, the new unit to you. That's likely to add up to the price of buying a new unit from Amazon and, if you factor in the hassle, probably not worth it.]+ 'Not grounded' red light (must be off) will warn you when there's something wrong. Belkin's warranty won't apply if the light was on when your devices got fried. I don't know if for a fact but I assume they have a way of telling if that was the case.+ 10 ft. long chord. This is very important to me and it was one of the criteria that had to be met when I ordered this item.+ 90 degree plug allows you to easily plug it into a busy 4-plugs wall outlet.+ Clip for cable management. I find it useful.+ Thin (one inch) and flat shape. Stands well on a table or on the floor.+ Telephone and coax cable pass through for surge protection. I don't use these but I'm surprised that something this inexpensive has them. Even better, the phone jacks come covered with some sealing foil and, if you don't use them, they stay near invisible. They are so well hidden, it took me some time to actually find them.[NOTE: The 'phone' jacks are RJ-45 (Ethernet), not RJ-11 (phone). I know that you can plug an RJ-11 connector into an RJ-45 receptacle and I believe that's okay but I did NOT test this feature on this surge protector.]Negatives:- Other than encouraging the unrealistic expectation that Belkin would pay you op to $300,000 on connected equipment warranty, I can't think of anything bad.Warranty--------On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a worthless warranty and 10 is one that's unbelievably generous, Belkin's should be somewhere around 2 or 3 - 95% of all warranties on devices this cheap are likely to be a 1.They do promise to replace the item if it sacrifices itself while protecting your devices for as long as you can prove that you didn't do anything stupid, you have a purchase receipt and you ship the damaged item to Belkin at your own expense. It's not clear if they will charge you for shipping you back a new item. This may or may not be something worth pursuing. My impression is that you are not going to save a lot of money to get a 'free' replacement from Belkin and you are likely to waste a lot of time in the process. I'd probably buy myself a new one if the one I have now stopped working but it's good to know that they do have a 'lifetime' warranty. By 'lifetime' they mean the natural life of the product but 'natural life' is not precisely defined.As far as being reimbursed for damage to devices that this surge protector was expected to protect, my impression is that you are not likely to get much if anything unless you can afford a lawyer and you are willing to sue.

I could have and maybe I should have removed one star from the over hyped ""$300,000 connected equipment warranty"" statement printed on the box but... as sad as it is, everybody does it and Belkin's warranty is better than most so, I am awarding 5 stars on an item that inexpensively addressed real issues I had with protecting many devices clustered in a corner of my basement.________________________________________________________Disclaimer:I would call myself the opposite of a Belkin shill. After reading the news stories concerning some Belkin employees' attempts at promoting their wares at Amazon via employee-written reviews and other unethical practices I tended to stay away from the Belkin brand.

It is USB 2.0 certified, meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and, if your device accepts a Mini-B plug, this is the cable to get.While USB cables are clearly a commodity item these days, AmazonBasics does have a couple of advantages over the competition.- EASY RETURN - I know because I had to return quite a few items for various reasons. Amazon makes it very easy and, if you are returning the item because it came defective or damaged Amazon pays for shipping.- WARRANTY - these wires come with a 1-year warranty (talking about future-proofing). If a cable performs for one year, the odds that it would stop working after that are pretty close to zero. It's possible that the other vendors back their inexpensive cables too (I never checked) but I am highly confident that Amazon will be around to honor its warranty and I'm not so sure about vendors I know less.- QUALITY ASSURANCE - I've never had any problems with 'cheap' USB or HDMI cables but it may be reassuring to have Amazon's name on a wire. My assumption is that Amazon did insist on some quality checks before they stamped their logo on the product.- PRICE - This cable may appear more expensive than others but keep in mind that, unlike most, it qualifies for SuperSavers and Amazon Prime free shipping.I am awarding this item 5 stars for price and quality - there's nothing to complain. However, I suggest that you look around before you place the order because you just might have one of these already as they tend to ship with many electronic gadgets these days.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need.Whenever in doubt, do some more research and keep in mind that the 'Micro-B' (very small) is the emerging standard and it's likely to be found on the newer and smaller gadgets - phones, cameras, Amazon's Kindle, etc. but, before it we had the 'Mini-B' (this specific cable) so the older devices will need the 'Mini'.","[20, 22]","Reasonably priced, 'standard' USB wire",2010,08, 30,0.9090909090909091,3331,585,Positive,20,22,2,0.022992997883080932,20100830

It should work with any device where you need a longer than average HDMI wire. At least pricewise, I believe we hit the bottom when it comes to super-cheap HDMI wires - at the time I am writing this the amount you pay for the cable basically covers the free shipping.Briefly: right length for most uses, right price and free shipping at the time I am writing this. On the negative side, this is a generic cable and you may find it difficult to return it if it doesn't work but, given the price - you pay less than other vendors would charge to ship you 2 or 3 units, it's worth it. As for it's no-name label... nobody other than me ever went to look at the back of my equipment to see what brand-name wires connect the various components and the overwhelming odds are that if the cable performs on day one it will continue to perform while left there.The 3-6 ft. are the optimum lengths to connect most electronics but you are still pretty safe with 'generics' even at the 10 ft. lengths.Just in case someone may feel guilty for not paying a lot more for a premium brand, it should be stated that at these lengths you will get as good a service from a no-brand cable as you would from a super-expensive named brand. An HDMI 1.3x cable should be able to carry, error free, all the signal your electronic equipment may put out. In fact, you can buy one or 2 extra 'cheap' cables, just in case. At these prices they're easily affordable.The FUD campaigns, trying to attract buyers toward the more expensive brands make a series of claims. I will address them, as they may apply to this specific cable.- Signal attenuation is less over a more expensive cable. - TRUE, BUT that's irrelevant on a 3-6 ft. length. The HDMI consortium stated that even the cables that were not 'certified' as 'Category 2' or 'High-Speed' will meet the requirements at lengths of 6 ft. or less and 10 ft. should be quite safe too. At these lengths it would be a waste to consider an 'expensive' alternative. In addition, the newer devices have sufficient processing power and are sensitive enough to properly interpret even the more ambiguous 'digits' they receive.- The expensive cables are better engineered and their contacts are less likely to break. - TRUE, BUT how many times is one going to plug/unplug an HDMI cable in and out of an HDMI socket over the cable's lifetime? 5 times? 10 times? The 'better engineered' claim has no practical importance. If your cable works on 'day one' the odds are that it will be left in the back of your box for many months or years before it is unplugged and plugged back in or somewhere else. If this cable is purchased for home use, the 'better engineered' claim should not be of a major concern.- The more expensive cables are 'future proof'. - NOT TRUE. Claims are made that, if you buy the more expensive wires you won't have to buy new ones when 'new standards' emerge because the more expensive wire will support them. This is untrue on 2 different levels. First, your cheap cable was purchased to work with some very specific devices which need HDMI 1.3 and will never support the 'new standard'. The new standards will be supported by new electronic devices but, for as long as you keep the existing ones, you will still need this cable to connect them. Second, the emerging HDMI 1.4 specs call for new features such as an Ethernet channel and an audio return channel, both of which can't be supported by the existing HDMI 1.3 cables so, no matter how large a bandwidth the existing expensive cables may support, it won't matter because you still won't able to use them if you are to take FULL advantage of an HDMI 1.4 device so... there goes your $5 invesment or... your $200, depending on your having purchased a 'cheap' or a 'top of the line' HDMI cable.________________________________________Here are the HDMI 1.3 specs supported by both this cable and its more expensive alternatives.Maximum signal bandwidth (MHz) 340Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s) 10.2Maximum video bandwidth (Gbit/s) 8.16Maximum audio bandwidth (Mbit/s) 36.86Maximum Color Depth (bit/px) 48Maximum resolution over single link at 24-bit/px  25601600p75Maximum resolution over single link at 30-bit/px  25601600p60Maximum resolution over single link at 36-bit/px  1920x1200p75Maximum resolution over single link at 48-bit/px  19201200p60sRGBYCbCr8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio capabilityBlu-ray Disc video and audio at full resolutionConsumer Electronic Control (CEC)DVD-Audio supportSuper Audio CD (DSD) supportDeep ColorxvYCCAuto lip-syncDolby TrueHD bitstream capableDTS-HD Master Audio bitstream capableUpdated list of CEC commands (only on HDMI 1.3a,b,c)________________________________________My personal experience: I've never paid 'a lot' for an HDMI cable because it makes no sense to pay more.

FUD is a manifestation of the appeal to fear.""Still Wikipedia, quoting Eric S. Raymond: ""The idea, of course, was to persuade buyers to go with safe [...] gear rather than with competitors' equipment. This implicit coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would happen to people who stuck with [...], but Dark Shadows loomed over the future of competitors' equipment [...]"".HDMI is all-digital for both sound and picture. As such, it either works or it doesn't and, when it doesn't work, you will know immediately. There's really nothing in-between. If a claim is made that the Monster is 'more reliable' or that it 'lasts longer', I can't see how such claim can be backed - does the hundred-dollar cable last 20 times longer than than the five-dollar cable? And, if it does, do we REALLY care that a cable supporting a standard that may be obsolete in 5 years COULD last for 100 years?By the way, I do not challenge the claim of high quality for this cable. It appears to be well built. However, it is quality not needed and, in my view, not worth paying for. The way most of us use cables is: we plug them at the back of our electronic boxes and, if they work on 'day one' they are likely to work in the exact same fashion on day 1000 because they are not going to be subjected to any physical or thermal stress and the materials used to build them are not easily degradable. While 'quality' was important for analog cables where good quality made all the difference in the world, the digital wires either transmit the digits or they don't. If they do, they all work the same, the $1 HDMI cable gives you the exact same 'performance' the $100, gold-plated cable does.The claims that seem to suggest that these expensive wires allow more Gigabytes of data to pass through and the implied suggestion that you would get a less bright image or a less crisp sound if you used a two-dollar cable are NOT true. The HDMI is a published standard and there is a minimum data throughput that must be supported. If it is, then the device is HDMI compliant and you will get everything that HDMI promises to deliver. If some cable exceeds the specified throughput, it's nice but it's irrelevant because no electronic component that's HDMI compliant would attempt to push more bytes through the wire than the standard specifies. If they did, they'd violate the specs and would not sell very well. If your electronic component had an HDMI port that called for an HDMI cable that exceeded the HDMI published standards, then it would no longer be called an HDMI port but a proprietary, non-standard solution.The following are the HDMI 1.3 specs and ALL certified HDMI 1.3 cables (including the five-dollar wires and the Monster) are going to support them.

The presenter suggests that all signals, including 'digital' get degraded when passing through a wire because of the 'laws of physics'. The key word in his presentation is that 'IF YOU HAVE A REALLY LONG CABLE' then you may get into trouble. This is true. You can't have a 100 ft. HDMI cable or a one mile-long cable. Eventually, unless your signal, digital or analog, is boosted in some way, it's going to die and you won't be able to decode it at the other end.However, this is NOT the point. This HDMI cable is NOT 'really long'. In fact, it is REALLY SHORT and, no matter how much FUD is inserted into the discussion, on 6 ft. or 8 ft. cables, you are NOT going to get a 'better' picture just because you pay 100 times more for a wire.Unless the vendor comes up with some unbiased tests showing that, on 6 ft. or on 8 ft. cables the less expensive brands loses 'bits' to the degree that the receiving device can't correct for the loss while the expensive brand does not, this is nothing but FUD.","[598, 660]",FUD - a perfect example,2009,01, 11,0.906060606060606,5060,838,Negative,598,660,62,0.03986321446018564,20090111

For reasons unknown, and I blame Sony, Vista could not read the CF card and claimed that the 'disc' had to be formatted. This is where this little device comes to the rescue. Once connected to my computer through a STANDARD USB cable (supplied) and once the CF card was inserted in the reader, I could copy back and forth without a problem. Case solved.

In a real-life benchmark, it copied 233MB (89 pictures) in 16 (sixteen) seconds. This was from a Kingston 16GB CompactFLASH 133X card card. I wish my camera was that quick reading the card.- The fact that, for less than one dollar (plus S&H;, of course) you even get a little USB wire.- The 'naked' or transparent styling of the case. Some may not appreciate the geekish look but I do.- Automatically recognized by Vista even though Vista wasn't even on the list of supported OSes.Issues and concerns:For the price, not too many but, here they are.- Must be careful when inserting the CF or MicroDrive cards. There are 'guides' that should help your card glide and insert itself into the proper pins but I can see how, if doing it in a hurry, you could bend the pins and then... you'll probably have to buy another one. The other 3 interfaces appear to be a little less fragile because they don't have pins.- I only tested the Compact Flash and the MicroDrive cards. I can't tell if the other interfaces work as well.- The red 'power on' LED showed me that the reader was properly interfacing with my computer but the LED that would have shown the CF card being in did not light up. It didn't make a difference to me but I don't know if this should be viewed as a defect or not.- I saw no warranty statement of any kind but... should I expect one on something this cheap?- I had no need to call for support and there is no support phone number anywhere but there IS a Web site which points to a directory tree whose branches are either locked up or empty. It's possible that the company is no longer in business and the reason we are getting this stuff this cheap is because it's post going out of business leftovers.Rating:Even considering the concerns I listed above, it gets 5 stars without hesitation.

There were 2 initial reasons:- my wife was missing a 'magic wand' shaped remote for playing movies- Amazon had it at a great price in one of them lightning dealsI ended up using it myself and, in fact, using it for more than just movie playing - see below.But, let's do a quick inventory of features:= It's blue-tooth enabled and, therefore, it's not taking any ports on your PS3. This is probably important for anyone who has a ""2-USB ports console"".= It's wand-shaped, allowing the non-gamers to control their movie-watching activities while holding a familiar-shaped device in their hand.= It maps ALL the six-axis buttons and performs everything a six-axis would do, except for the joystick features of R3 and L3 (but you do have the push-down or 'click' abilities for them).= 2 AA battery powered (still with the original Sony batteries after 4 months of use)= Includes additional buttons that the movie-only users would expect on a remote such as:+ a number pad+ eject+ red, green, blue, yellow buttons+ play, stop, pause+ slow(step), scan(left/right), prev/next+ display, top menu, pop up menu, return+ subtitles, angle, audioWhat is interesting about this remote is that you can use it for much more than movie-playing. Given that it has all the six-axis buttons, guess what? You can use it, and I do use it to:- surf the web- play music- shop at the PSN store- play certain games such as Sudoku- turn the PS3 on/off when your six-axis controllers are in the charger and I am playing GT5 that is using a racing wheelAnd, yes, you CAN turn the PS3 on and off with this remote. Turning it on is easy - you simply press the PlayStation button and the PS3 turns itself on. To turn it off, you either go as far to the left on the X-bar and all the way up and press Enter (the turn-off PlayStation icon will be highlighted) or you simply hold the PlayStation button pressed for a few seconds and then select 'yes' and press the X button a couple of times.Overall: I am happy with this peripheral. Yes, it's one more remote control but it's a pretty good one, for the reasons I stated above._______________________________Notes - Aug 29, 2009, after 16 months of useI find that I'm using the remote more and more, not only for playing movies but for navigating the XMB and at the PSN Store, also when playing music or slideshows. Due to its very convenient arrows wheel with an 'enter' button in the middle, navigating the PS3 and doing just about anything other than playing games is a lot easier than using the PS3 game controller. Unlike the controller which normally requires two hands to hold, this is basically a one-hand operation where you hold the remote in one hand and operate the wheel with your thumb. And because it's Bluetooth, not IR (Infrared), you don't even need to point it at the PS3.And, one word on battery life. After about 15-16 months of operation, this is probably the third set of batteries so I'd estimate battery life to be about 4-6 months.

If you need to take on the road something other than mostly static documents, that may require lots of disk read/writes, you are much better off with a small USB hard drive which could fit nicely inside your laptop bag or you may could get a faster flash drive for a few extra dollars.Compared with the equivalent (in price and storage)Kingston 8GB DataTraveler USB flash drive - High Speed USB, this one's advantage is that the USB connector is retractable, thus protecting it.

I am actually using 3 ft. cables whenever the connected devices happen to be very close to each other.Just in case someone may feel guilty for not paying a lot more for a premium brand, it should be stated that at this lengths - 3-6 ft., you will get as good a service from a no-brand cable as you would from a super-expensive rip-off. An HDMI 1.3x cable should be able to carry, error free, all the signal your electronic equipment may put out.The FUD campaigns, trying to attract buyers toward the more expensive brands make a series of claims. I will address them, as they may apply to this specific cable.- Signal attenuation is less over a more expensive cable. - TRUE, BUT that's irrelevant on a 3-6 ft. length. The HDMI consortium stated that even the cables that were not 'certified' as 'Category 2' or 'High-Speed' will meet the requirements at lengths of 6 ft. or less.  At 3-6 ft., it would be a waste to consider an 'expensive' alternative. In addition, the newer devices have sufficient processing power and are sensitive enough to properly interpret even the more ambiguous 'digits' they receive.- The expensive cables are better engineered and their contacts are less likely to break. - TRUE, BUT how many times is one going to plug/unplug an HDMI cable in and out of an HDMI socket over the cable's lifetime? 5 times? 10 times? The 'better engineered' claim has no practical importance. If your cable works on 'day one' the odds are that it will be left in the back of your box for many months or years before it is unplugged and plugged back in. If this cable is purchased for home use, the 'better engineered' claim should not be of a major concern.- The more expensive cables are 'future proof'. - NOT TRUE. Claims are made that, if you buy the more expensive wires you won't have to buy new ones when 'new standards' emerge because the more expensive wire will support them. This is untrue on 2 different levels. First, your cheap cable was purchased to work with some very specific devices which need HDMI 1.3 and will never support the 'new standard'. The new standards will be supported by new electronic devices but, for as long as you keep the existing ones, you will still need this cable to connect them. Second, the emerging HDMI 1.4 specs call for new features such as an Ethernet channel and an audio return channel, both of which can't be supported by the existing HDMI 1.3 cables so, no matter how large a bandwidth the existing expensive cables may support, it won't matter because you still won't able to use them if you are to take full advantage of an HDMI 1.4 device so... there goes your $5 invesment or... your $200, depending on your having purchased a 'cheap' or a 'top of the line' HDMI cable.________________________________________Here are the HDMI 1.3 specs supported by both this cable and its more expensive alternatives.Maximum signal bandwidth (MHz) 340Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s) 10.2Maximum video bandwidth (Gbit/s) 8.16Maximum audio bandwidth (Mbit/s) 36.86Maximum Color Depth (bit/px) 48Maximum resolution over single link at 24-bit/px  25601600p75Maximum resolution over single link at 30-bit/px  25601600p60Maximum resolution over single link at 36-bit/px  1920x1200p75Maximum resolution over single link at 48-bit/px  19201200p60sRGBYCbCr8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio capabilityBlu-ray Disc video and audio at full resolutionConsumer Electronic Control (CEC)DVD-Audio supportSuper Audio CD (DSD) supportDeep ColorxvYCCAuto lip-syncDolby TrueHD bitstream capableDTS-HD Master Audio bitstream capableUpdated list of CEC commands (only on HDMI 1.3a,b,c)________________________________________My personal experience: I've never paid 'a lot' for an HDMI cable because it makes no sense to pay more.

Aware of the no-so-stellar Amazon reviews, I actually tried it at the store and made sure that I was allowed to return it if it did not work properly or if it stopped working after a few days. My unit is still working and what follows is my review.- Design:It's probably the best thing about this unit. It looks positively cute. Being as small and thin as it is, it does not take a lot of space and it can fit well on a desk, on a dresser or, if you want to go through the trouble, it could hang on the wall.

The sound is pretty good for a cheap stereo but I will not be surprised if the CD player stops playing long before the radio gives up - which means that I will still be left with a nice radio and an alarm clock.I will give this unit 5 stars for design and 4 stars for features and sound quality.

In my case, it fulfills the task assigned - store a large number of photos for an electronic picture frame to display. However, its relatively low write speed may NOT make it suitable if the intended use was in a camera taking large 'rapid fire' shots.PERFORMANCEI would like to note that I did not test the card with a camera but it's stated 'Class 4' speed class, which is the equivalent of a 26x speed rating should guarantee a MINIMUM of 4MB/s.Unlike the 'x' ratings, the speed class ratings are NOT certified by an independent body so, more or less, you will have to decide whether you trust the card's maker. It so happens that I DID test the card myself and I found that I could copy 1.6 GB worth of photos in about 5 minutes. This is 5MB/s for writing on the card for the first time, indicating that the Class 4/26x claim is honest.Practically, if you are going to use this card in a camera, depending on the quality of the pics you are taking, you may or may not be happy with its performance. At 12 megapixels, a 100% quality JPG would produce a 2-3 MB file so, without even counting the overhead, your camera will spend about half second, possibly more to write to the card which may or may not be in line with your own expectation. For better performance, look for a higher 'class' number 133x/Class 20, for example, should support 20 MB/s or writing up to 10 12-megapixel JPG photo files per second.ADDITIONAL FEATURES/CONCERNSThe card comes formatted as FAT32 and my Vista Enterprise computer was able to write to it. If, for whatever reason, FAT32 is not what you need, you should be able to format it under Windows/Vista, Mac or Unix/Linux to whatever you may need.Not ALL cameras support FAT32. Older cameras may only be aware of FAT16 and can't see any card larger that 4GB. If in doubt, check with the manufacturer or maybe read your camera's reviews at Amazon.Related to the above - anyone who may have a device meant to use SD cards should be aware that SDHC may not work with it so it's better to ask the maker.Finally, one nice thing about HP's card - it comes with a write-protect tab. If you are not using your card in a camera and want to prevent accidental writes, move the tab to the 'lock' position but, be careful, it will NOT work with your camera if you forget to move the tab back to 'unlock'.RATINGThis is a honestly rated Class 4 card. Class 4, as I explained, means SLOW so, if blazing-fast write speed is not an issue, this is probably what you need given the price and the maker's reputation - by the way, the card is manufactured in Japan.For what it is, the card deserves 5 stars.","[16, 17]",Good quality/price but not a top-speed champion (Class 4 does not mean 'fast'),2010,02, 19,0.9411764705882353,2755,506,Positive,16,17,1,0.022895293926070672,20100219

For the warranty to be honored, the unit needs to be properly installed - plugged into a grounded 3-wire AC outlet, not used with a non-Panamax extension cord, have all power reaching the equipment pass through the Panamax device, and so on.There is a $5,000,000 lifetime warranty on connected equipment. As expected, whenever such astronomical figures are involved, the restrictions are numerous but, if you meet Panamax conditions such us: you buy the equipment from a recognized dealer, operate it according to specs, provide Panamax with schematics of your setup, ship the Panamax unit to them for inspection and investigation, etc., etc. you may be reimbursed for your loss.MY EVALUATIONInstallation was easy in my case. Panamax classifies the MFP-400 as a 'floor unit' and therefore I decided not to mount, even though everything needed to actually mount it comes with the product. It was as easy as plugging it into a grounded outlet, connecting the equipment and running the satellite coax wire through the MFP-400. Ever since, it's been sitting behind my entertainment center, hopefully protecting it.I will give this product 4 star not because there is anything wrong with it but for the overly restrictive warranty policies. This is supposed to be a household product and, whether you buy it from an authorized dealer or not, it should be you, the buyer, who actually plug it in so buying it 'new' from... whomever should not diminish the equipment's ability to operate properly. A requirement to 'register' the newly purchased product would be more reasonable. In addition, Panamax better explaining why using a 'power line conditioner' is important and in what significant ways this product is different from a surge protector would help.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[1, 1]","First, do no harm",2010,11, 27,1.0,4573,712,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20101127

""Try it and you will see"" he said. So, I did, after making sure that the store was going to allow me to return it for a cash refund, no questions asked.I took this super-expensive wire home, I replaced the existing free HDMI wire that came with the satellite receiver and was connecting it to the TV with the Monster and... I saw no difference. Then, I unplugged the five-dollar HDMI wire that connected my Blu-ray player to the TV and plugged the Monster in its place and... I saw no difference. I returned this item to the store and decided to keep using my super-cheap or free HDMI cables because there is absolutely no difference between a five-dollar wire or a cheap-looking free wire that comes with some device that you buy and this expensive cable.HDMI is all-digital for both sound and picture. As such, it either works or it doesn't. There's really nothing in-between. If a claim is made that thd Monster is 'more reliable' or that it 'lasts longer', I can't see how such claim can be backed - does the fifty-dollar cable last 10 times longer than than the five-dollar cable? I've been using inexpensive HDMI cables for 1-2 years already and none of them has failed me yet. As for 'the looks', they are not important? I plug my cables in the back of things and, hopefully, I don't need to see them very often.By the way, I don't challenge the claim of high quality for this cable. It looks well built. However, it is quality not needed and, in my view, not worth paying for. The way most of us use cables is: we plug them at the back of our electronic boxes and, if they work on day one they are likely to work in the exact same fashion on day 1000 because they are not going to be subjected to any physical or thermal stress and the materials used to build them are not degradable. While 'quality' was important for analog cables cable where a good quality cable make all the difference in the world, the digital wires either transmit the digits or they don't. If they do, they all work the same, the $1 HDMI cable gives you the exact same 'performance' the $100, gold-plated cable does.The claims made that these expensive wires allow more Gigabytes of data to pass through may be true but they are irrelevant. The HDMI is a published standard and there is a minimum data throughput that must be supported. If it is, then the device is HDMI compliant. If some cable exceeds the specified throughput, it's nice but it's irrelevant because no electronic component that's HDMI compliant would attempt to push more bytes through the wire than the standard specifies because if they did, they'd violate the specs and would not sell very well. If your electronic component had an HDMI port that called for an HDMI cable that exceeded the HDMI published standards, then it would no longer be called an HDMI port but a proprietary, non-standard solution.","[49, 51]",Paying extra for... nothing?,2008,11, 15,0.9607843137254902,2964,532,Negative,49,51,2,0.023937469467513434,20081115

Suffices to say that it is adequately supplied with memory, has enough disk storage for anything other than an extensive movie collection and comes with... hmmm... Vista.On the computer itself, it is a true laptop, meaning that it's not a TOO large mini-super-computer-emulator (like my oter son's IMMENSE 17"" Toshiba Satellite) but not too small either. The display looks great. The keyboard is only adequate. This model does not come with a mouse so, if you don't want to depend on the little touchpad, make sure you have a USB mouse handy, preferably wireless.Installation... well you turn it on and it works. As it is always the case with 'consumer' computers, as soon as you turn it on, you are bombarded with tons of tutorials and various pre-installed trashware/bloatware - the usual suspects: AOL, Macaffee, Adobe, Norton... It took me a couple of hours to clean it up and leave only the stuff that was not on a 'trial' base and get rid of all the well-meaning spyware.So, after cleanup, we got ourselves a nice, Wi-Fi enabled, AOL/Explorer/Macaffee/Norton-free little laptop that my son loves using for his personal entertainment and for the occasional school homework - Microsoft Works comes pre-installed for that.Battery life appears to be adequate but the battery is relatively slow to charge - I guess you can't have everything at the same time.On the 'cool' factor. The laptop comes equipped with a built-in camera almost invisible, it plays DVDs and, of course it has a microphone. My kid also likes the text-to-speech capability but he's telling me that the computer is more often wrong than right when interpreting his words.The COOLEST stuff that DOES work is the fingerprint authentication. You provide the computer your fingerprints and you no longer need to enter username/password ever again. I like it a lot because, anytime he needs to install something (he's not an Admin, of course) he brings the laptop to me and all I need to do is swipe a finger over the reader and... it's done.I never had to call the Sony customer service, so I can't comment on that. I am very much a do-it-yourself type when it comes to computer (never on cars).Overall rating: I am satisfied with the the laptop but the keyboard could have been better.

The card data blocks tend to 'wear out' if they are written to many times and, eventually, the card's ability to store data reliably may decrease.Not many computers and/or laptop come with a CF interface these days. When one's own computer/laptop lacks a CF interface, 'CF to...' adapters are available or the camera's own facilities can be used to transfer the data out. This should not be as big of a problem as it may seem because nearly all D-SLR cameras do allow transfers out through a USB cable.My frame of reference:---------------------I purchased this 8GB CF card for my Sony A-100 SLR camera.

For the sake of comparison, the 300x rated cards have a 45MB/s data transfer speed.After the initial format, the camera indicated that it had room for about 2000 pictures at 10M/fine resolution. Past experience with a 4GB Microdrive that's almost full shows that the estimated figure is likely to be exceeded and I may be able to have as many as 5-6000 photos.On the same platform (the Sony A-100 D-SLR), the Kingston Elite Pro was consistently faster when compared to the Hitachi 4GB Microdrive. The 3-shot bursts and the continuous shooting seem to be advancing at a 2-3 frames per second clip while shooting 'large' 10.4 megapixel photos. When in continuous mode, I did not notice a slow down after taking about 20 shots. Again, when compared to the Hitachi Microdrive, scrolling on the camera was marginally faster and so was zooming.Moving the data out of the card appeared to be significantly faster than the Microdrive's both when directly plugged into a PS3 or desktop CF interface or when transferred out of the camera through s USB cable.It should be noted that the card is designed to support the FAT32 file system.

Check your gadget's manual before you place your order.- The 'High Speed' rating is largely meaningless, indicating that the cable supports 1080p video - almost all do and no one should ever consider buying anything less.- 6 ft. (really 2 meters) length is just about right. The cable is long enough to allow for a connection to the back of your TV or receiver while the 'mini' end can be pulled to the front where your camera would plug.- Black or dark grey - Given that this is a visible HDMI cable, not something that goes to the back of your entertainment center, a lighter grey would have been better and the 'mini' end of the cable could have had a nicer design.I had no trouble to plug the Mini end into my MinoHD (I know...) and the regular into a TV and play video directly. Playback was flawless and, even though this is not something that everyone needs or anyone needs often, it doesn't hurt having one around.I am granting this cable 5 stars because I can't find any faults to it other than maybe looks but they're compensated by the right price.","[0, 0]",Perfect (except maybe for 'looks'),2012,02, 5,,1453,267,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20120205

I did not promise a 'good review' in exchange.Here's my brief assessment: this is not the perfect laptop case but, for the price this is offered at Amazon, it's a very good deal and I will explain why.- it's made of the same ballistic nylon most laptop cases are made these days- it's quite a space saver if all you need to carry around is your laptop, with enough room for your laptop and accessories but not a lot of 'extra' compartments- comes with sufficient pockets and partitions to hold your laptop's accessories: 2 big pockets of which a padded one is on the outside and 3 smaller mesh pockets plus holders for a few pens- comes with a removable shoulder strap- zippers work well- your laptop is held in place with two adjustable Velcro strapsBut, like I said, not everything is perfect and these are the tradeoffs that probably explain the super-low price:- while it is padded on all sides, the padding is rather thin- the adjustable straps holding the laptop in place aren't fully adjustable and you may need to squeeze in 'something', (maybe the power brick?) to keep your laptop firmly in place and prevent it from sliding sidewaysOverall, I like it because it offers a reasonable level of protection for a laptop, therefore 4 stars.

It performs flawlessly on any solid surface I've tested it so far. Size is a little larger than what I would consider a 'regular' size mouse but it's ergonomically shaped to fit the human hand - both me and my 12 yr. old kid felt comfortable using it.Other notable features include: quick and easy plug-and-play setup (no disk), up to 8 months claimed battery life (could not verify that because we've only had it for a couple of weeks), extended features and customization can be achieved by downloading and installing software off Logitech's Web site.If what you need is a cordless mouse for your dektop, it can't get much better than this. If you need a mouse for your laptop and you don't mind sacrificing this unit's precision, the Nano line is probably the better option because of the large, USB-plugged receiver the mouse needs to operate._________________________________________________________________THE EXTENDED EVALUATIONContents:---------- the mouse itself- large (about 2"" wide) corded receiver that plugs into a USB port - a good thing if you're using the mouse with your desktop computer,- PS2 to USB adapter that would allow you to plug the mouse into a dedicated mouse port- 2 AA batteries- glossy, multiple-languages setup/troubleshooting quick reference sheetMechanics/ergonomics:---------------------As I stated above, the mouse is a bit larger than 'normal' size. It feels good in my hands (I am 6'2"") and it feels right in my 12 yr. old's hand as well. Form-wise, it's as perfect as it can be for a 2-button/wheeled mouse. It is well balanced and the rubberized sides allow for a good grip.A VERY good thing is the mouse becoming operational shortly after the receiver is plugged in - no installation required for just basic functions.Logitech claims that this mouse is 'high definition'. As one who owns a couple of Nano models (a Logitech and a Verbatim) I will confirm that the LX6 is much more precise and responsive with smooth and accurate control.As in its Logitech Nano cousin, the wheel is clickable and, with software installed, will have it's right/left tilt interpreted as configured.The batteries are relatively easy to insert and remove. Battery life expectation (2 AA's) is 8 months if the small 'on/off' button on the bottom of the mouse is used. Also on the bottom side, a small LED turns on to indicate that the mouse is on and connected. On the top, right behind the wheel, there is a battery life indicator light. Since I've only have the mouse for a couple of weeks, it's not clear what it will do when the battery is about to run out but I expect some blinking.I tested the wireless capabilities with the mouse up to 20 feet away from the computer and the mouse operated as expected.Customization:--------------I STRONGLY recommend that all who purchased this mouse goes to the Logitech site (it's Logitech dot com slash download) and install the SetPoint software. SetPoint adds A LOT of functionality. By the way, anyone can download the software - no need to actually have a mouse - so, if you want to see what you can do with your mouse before actually buying it, do install SetPoint and see what's available. Briefly, these are the advantages of SetPoint running on your computer - again, I am using the mouse on a Vista machine and some features may be specific to this operating system.- Swap the 2 buttons- Tilting the scroll wheel right/left would do left/right scroll by default but it can be set to back/forward, previous/next, cruise up/down, even to specific keystroke assignments. Oh, and these can be done for 'all apps' or specific settings can be applied to an expandable list of specific applications - i posted an image showing the buttons setup first screen.- Mouse movement can be customized for speed, acceleration, pointer trails and so on.- A special 'gaming' setup is available and there is a 'game detection' option that can be activated - see the image I posted, showing the 'gaming' setup screen.- Scrolling can be customized for acceleration on the vertical and horizontal AND for specific applications, if desired.Conclusion:-----------The LX6 is well-suited for a desktop a even a laptop if precision is what is needed. I am VERY happy with it and, in fact, I'm not the only one in our household who feels this way :) - it may end up with one of my kids, eventually. The positives for this mouse are:- Trouble-free operation.- Easy initial setup.- Customizable through software and feature-rich.- Well designed.- 5 year limited warranty, so make sure you keep that receipt.As far as 'concerns' - and they are not necessarily 'negatives':- It should be understood that this is NOT a Bluetooth device. Not being a Bluetooth device makes the setup and moving from one computer to another a lot easier (no need for pairing) but the receiver WILL take over a USB port so one should be mindful of this.- The USB receiver size makes it somewhat inconvenient for using it with laptops.- The on/off button on the bottom of the mouse is an interesting solution but, I bet, I will not always remember to turn off my mouse after done with using it._____________________________________Overall, this is a 5 star product IF used as intended, with a desktop. For laptop use, it should be a 4-star.","[7, 7]","For desktops, as close to perfect as they come",2009,12, 24,1.0,5409,908,Positive,7,7,0,0.022634750040709983,20091224

Based on my experience with WD (I own several), the Scorpios are reliable drives. The 2.5"" SATAs easily and perfectly mount inside the PS3's drive bay where they can replace PS3's original 20-40-60-80-160 GB drive without voiding Sony's warranty.______________________________________PS3 Upgrade:I have replaced my original PS3 drive with a 320 GB WD quite a while ago but, over the last weekend, I helped a friend of mine upgrade his PS3's with this one. He decided to pick this model and, since I had a great experience with the 320GB version, I encouraged him to go WD.My friend believes that the 500GB is at the peak of price/performance curve at this time. Like me, he has no plans of storing a movie library on the PS3 so he expects for the 500 GB to be sufficient for the life of his console. After that, it's likely that he'll be buying the next generation game/multimedia machine. The 320 GB model that I used some time ago is still available but the 500 GB is only $30 more so it makes a lot of sense to spend a little more and enjoy the extra storage.Advice to the PS3 upgraders from someone who, after some hesitation, actually did it and then did it again a few more times for friends and family since:- If you need to format this drive or any drive to FAT32 - and you need a FAT32 partition for the PS3 backup - the best utility I found was FAT32FORMAT.EXE - Google it and you shall find it out there. I'm not reviewing the formatter utility but I can tell you that it does a drive in less than 10 seconds AND it works on Vista too.- It helps to have a USB-connected drive handy to back up your PS3 content before upgrading. With one of these as the backup device, the PS3 fully restores EVERYTHING, including whatever copywrited or protected objects, such as, in my case the PS2 memory cards emulations and all the game saves.I will not go into upgrade details because there are lots of guides on the Net including great Youtube videos on how to do it but, if anyone has any questions, do leave a note and I shall reply as soon as I get to read it.To conclude, the upgrade proceeded without any glitches and my friend has now a perfectly working console where storage won't be an issue for some time to come. PS3 performance appears to the same, which is how it should be. I haven't heard back from my friend in 8 days now so, my assumption is that all is working well and he's busy enjoying his upgraded PS3.______________________________________Laptop Upgrade:My 2 year old Thinkpad T60 came with a wimpy 60GB SATA drive. I needed  the ability to upgrade to the much larger 500GB and do it without having to reinstall the OS, apply the service packs and then reinstall and configure 100 different little apps.Acronis True Image Home 2009 PC Backup & Recoveryallowed me to do all of the above in about one hour. Its Utilities section has a 'clone' option that would copy EVERYTHING, including the Master Boot Record/Sector (MBR) from the puny 60GB drive unto the 500GB while allowing me to control the size of the active partition - this while the 500GB was connected through a USB wire and the laptop booted off the program's CD.Once the operation completed (50 minutes) I simply removed the old 60GB drive off my laptop and replaced it with the 500GB drive. Once the laptop was turned back on it booted up happily, with a 200GB master partition and a 300GB second partition. There are 3 words that I have to use to describe the process: PERFECTION and COMPLETE SATISFACTION. This capability alone is worth the price of this product.To my surprise, with the new drive, the Primary Hard Disk score as computed by Microsoft (right click on 'My computer' then select 'Properties') jumped from a decent 4.8 to an unexpected 5.7.","[1, 1]",Highly recommended for a laptop or PS3 upgrade,2009,06, 2,1.0,3840,687,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20090602

Well... it ""guarantees a certified cable bandwidth of 10.2"" Okay, but the Monster also supports ""x.v.Color, and Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD"". It turns out that, all of the above, and more, are part of the HDMI 1.3 specs and they are fully supported by every cable that complies to the standard and can be had for about 95% less in the Premium Gold. The expensive brand presentation simply enumerates the HDMI 1.3 specs as if it being HDMI 1.3 compliant was a really big deal. It is not a big deal. Even a cable that costs 95% less is HDMI 1.3 compliant.My suggestion: if you think that the proponents of the expensive brand have a point when they claim that their product is a lot more durable, buy TWO Premium Gold wires and still pay almost 90% less than you would pay for one of the expensive ones.My personal experience: I've never paid 'a lot' for an HDMI cable because it makes no sense to pay more. I took home one of the 'expensive' ones once because the salesman promised to take it back if I wasn't amazed by the difference.

I would say that this little player is worth about what I paid for at one of Amazon's one-hour specials.I will first summarize what I got for my money and then I will have some closing thoughts where I will explain my rating.- The contents -The little box includes the player itself with a rechargeable battery (up to 22 hours of music playback or radio play on a full charge claimed) inside, a protective silicone skin, neck lanyard, a multi-lingual manual with the English section being 6 or 7 very small pages, the headphones, a WHITE (everything else is black) USB cable and a mini disk that has an extended version of the manual plus a video file conversion utility, a slide show maker and some utility that is supposed to password-protect files that one would save on the device.There is NO charger. The expectation is that the person who owns the player will use a computer to charge it through the USB cable. For those of us who don't carry a charged laptop next to their MP3 player, I found that a Blackberry charger works. I suspect that other independent USB chargers work as well.- Design, ergonomics -The player itself is not too bad looking. The screen is small but bright. The main 'button', below the screen, has the central button as the on/off, OK, and some select functions. It is surrounded by the up/down and right/left. These are not 'touch' buttons, you have to push them with some force for something to happen and, due to the player's slow response I found myself pushing the same button more than once before the player responded.There is a 'menu button' and a 'red dot' button on the right side and a 'lock' button on the left side. The buttons are not always responsive and it can take several seconds before an input is acknowledged by the player (more about that later when I discuss 'performance'). It is possible to press the 'left' or 'right' button and to cause the player to display the 'goodbye' message because the central button was accidentally activated when touching it meant 'turn off'.The interface is basic and anything that's a bit more 'complex', such as organizing a playlist can be difficult to execute.- Features -Computer interface:Any file can be loaded off a computer by simply connecting via the USB port, at which time the player becomes a 'removable drive'. .mp3, .wma, .jpg, .txt and other file types can be simply dropped into the 'drive' and they will be played or displayed as appropriate. Given that the device looks like a drive to the computer, one can create folders to better organize content.Music player:Play is adequate but accessing your favorite song once you have hundreds is a different matter. I am repeating myself but the fact is that the interface and ease of use leave a lot of room for improvement.Photo display:Pictures are displayed off a separate menu and, like the songs, can be difficult to organize. It can take 5 to 10 seconds to display a 4MB file. I have little doubt that, had I reduced the size/resolution of my photos, they would have been displayed a lot quicker but I didn't feel that the user was 'expected' to convert dozens or hundreds of picture files prior to loading them on the player.Voice recording:It works and the 'voice activated' trigger is useful. If one takes the time to meaningfully rename the voice files, they could become meaningful records.Radio playing:20 FM stations can be preset on 20 'channels' and one can listen to a preset channel or seek a station not yet saved. The controls are a bit awkward but this is becoming a 'constant' observation already. An interesting feature is its ability to automatically scan the spectrum and assign stations to each of the 20 channels. It's a nice idea but, in my case, the same stations were assigned to 3 or 4 channels and some of the stations 'found' were nothing but static hiss.Video:I did not test it yet and it's not something that we are going to use. My son wanted a 'music player'. To play videos we have big screen TV's and laptops that do a much better job. I will enter my impressions here, once I have a chance to test it.E-book:Yes, it opens text files but one must be irresponsible to attempt actually reading a book on a postage-stamp size screen. We only have one pair of eyes and they don't get any better.Clock:Apparently, this model was not meant to be sold in the US. When setting the clock, you will find that the 'Pacific' time zone is labeled 'United States' and 'Eastern' seems to be called 'Venezuela'. Daylight savings time is available as an option to check but, who knows when that kicks in, since my time zone is 'Venezuela' now.File storage:I suppose this is a possibility but, with 8Gb thumb drives available for about $10, it would be a waste of MP3 player to actually attempt to use it as a file storage device.- Performance, quality -The player is overall slow. It is slow to respond to commands, slow to display large files, slow to turn itself on or off.The quality of sound is acceptable and the basic (as in cheap) ear buds could be easily replaced with something better.To conclude, this is something that my first born is likely to use for a while until he manages to impress me (good grades or some new belt color in Taekwando) into getting him something better. It's also a good way for him to get used with the concept of an MP3/gadget.This model's several shortcomings would normally earn it a 2-star but the not-so-high price pulls it up into the 3-star territory. I view it as a 'disposable' gadget and, as such, it can be considered a 'good buy'.To be fair, my little guy would give this 5 stars without hesitation.

The speakers are adequate for a monitor. I am, in fact using them to play the radio while working and they play it well.What's not to like? On my Vista machine either My Display or the drivers, as loaded from the supplied disk did not install properly. I had to load the latest version from HP's site and all appears to be okay at this time. I also don't like the on-off button placed at the top of the monitor. It's not a 'touch sensitive' button but it requires to physically push it down to turn the monitor on-off. I hope it will last.Overall, I am happy with this monitor. I am using it at home for both work and some non-work tasks. The few software glitches that I mentioned might have more to do with Vista than HP and I decided that software issues, especially those that are easily fixed through updates should not have as much weight as the hardware itself in the case of a monitor. The only major concern is the likelihood that, sooner or later, the monitor's corner will bruise itself and possibly scratch the monitor's stand while rotating it to 'portrait' or back.The 4.5 stars are rounded up to 5.","[2, 2]","One of the best in its class, for sure",2009,03, 5,1.0,2416,432,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20090305

All devices, including the wireless printer and the VOIP box connected without a problem.To my surprise, LELA is not on the CD. It took me longer to find, download and install LELA (Linksys EasyLink Advisor) that to complete the initial setup. I strongly recommend that you do install LELA because, besides the nice graphic of your home network it allows you to restore broken connections without having to turn off the router.As far as performance is concerned, I believe that I notice a slight but not significant improvement over my old 801.11b router. We have about one dozen connected devices: desktops, laptops, a PS3, a PSP, VOIP, printer and, with all on, everything worked just fine. With the router in the basement, I had '3-bars' on a computer 15-20 feet from the router. Surprisingly, I had 3 bars on the first and on the second floor as well and I had the same 3 bars outside, about 90 feet from the router, by the pool. The old router gave me 4 bars in the basement but only 3 bars in the rest of the house and only 1 or 2 bars with intermittent disconnections outside the house.With LELA running, I was able to quickly fix the 2-3 disconnections that occurred over a 3-day period without having to power off the router. This was better than my old 801.11b that had me power off the cable modem and the router whenever the connection to the Internet stopped working.Overall, I am very happy with my new router so far. It's probably as good as any 801.11g device can get.___________________________________________DNS issues update:With DHCP, strangely, after a few months of operation, the router began to 'forget' about passing DNS queries to the outside server. It KNOWS about the 3 DNS servers the ISP has but, out of the blue I get 'resolving host' errors and LELA claims that I'm no longer connected to the Internet. This while VoIP, connected to the same router works without a problem and so do the PS3 and my kids computers.The initial 'solution' was to power off the router and then power it back on.I have no idea why this was happening yet but, this is my quick solution: on the 'Network and Sharing Center' click on your connection 'View status' then 'Properties', highlight 'Internet Protocol Version 4...', 'Properties', 'Advanced', from the DNS tab click on 'Add...' and enter all the DNS servers that your router has listed under 'Status'.This eliminated all problems._________________________________________________Update July 3, 2013One star goes off for the horrible customer service. After spending over an hour, being moved back and forth from 'customer support' to 'tech support' and back, Cisco decided they would NOT sell me a replacement power adapter (original had been destroyed in an electrical storm) because my unit was out of warranty. This is NOT the way to keep your customers happy or keep your customers at all. Apparently, Cisco believes that, at least when it comes to 'home' products, their customers are on their own once the warranty expires.Way to go Cisco but, wherever you're going, I'm no longer with you.","[2, 2]","Easy setup, near trouble-free operation.

The new standards will be supported by new electronic devices but, for as long as you keep the existing ones, you will still need this cable to connect them. Second, the emerging HDMI 1.4 specs call for new features such as an Ethernet channel and an audio return channel, both of which can't be supported by the existing HDMI 1.3 cables so, no matter how large a bandwidth the existing expensive cables may support, it won't matter because you still won't able to use them if you are to take full advantage of an HDMI 1.4 device so... there goes your $5 invesment or... your $200 investment, depending on your having purchased a 'cheap' or a 'top of the line' HDMI cable.

In addition, it offers many features that I will probably never need but it's good to know they exist. Its navigation capabilities are generally comparable with some of the more popular brands and many of its features are only found in the other vendors' higher-end offerings such us support for gesture commands. Traffic information is available via subscription with the first 3 months free.Besides being a GPS, it can easily pair with Bluetooth-enabled phones as an audio device. A Memory Stick Duo can be inserted to allow for backups of stored information such as address books, phone book and saved routes.The provided suction-cup mount proved to be very effective. It's been on the windshield for a couple of months already and... it's still there.A near-complete 31 page manual is available on the disk as a .PDF. The disk also installs the 'nav-u tool' application on a PC to allow for firmware upgrades and other downloads via a USB cable.As a GPS--------I did read the other reviews before deciding to buy this unit. I decided to go with Sony and not Garmin or Tom-Tom or Nuvi because I already own a Garmin and, while quite reliable, it's not perfect and on most of my local trips where I am familiar with the local roads it does not always take me to my destination on the optimal path. The reviews state that Sony's device too does not always recommend the best path. I can testify that this is, indeed the case. On a head-to-head comparison, Sony was as bad as Garmin on all but one turn - it actually knew about a shortcut Garmin didn't. On the other hand, Garmin knew of a shortcut that Sony didn't. So, it's almost parity.I am happy with Sony's 4.8"", wide display. The touch screen resolution is good enough to allow for a lot of detail to be displayed.Besides the map, the normal display during navigation would show:- current direction and speed- current position and GPS status indication- a compass showing the straight-line direction for the destination- current time- current street name- ETA and distance to destination- distance to next turn- next street name- next turn instruction- current positionWhen approaching a turn you can see:- a maginfied view of the intersection on the left half of the screen- a bar indication of the distance to the next turnWhile on highway, a display would show on which lane to stay whenever the road splits or merges. The GPS can be set to show exits on the map and to warn of upcoming merges from right or left.This may seem to be very 'busy' but it does not look that way at all while driving.The device can be set to display a variety of points of interest on the map, from specific types of restaurants to gas stations to actual towns. The display can also be set to adjust colors on day/night with 7 color schemes available. The map can be either 2-D or 3 different types of 3-D, set a various levels of magnification ranging from a few hundred feet to about 50 miles and so on and so forth.Gesture commands can increase/decrease the level of magnification by simply drawing a circle clockwise or counter-clockwise on the screen.Text to speech makes a best effort attempt to pronounce street names. For English you can pick between a female (default) or a male voice.When traffic info is used, the GPS can be set to automatically recalculate the route to avoid high-volume traffic, accidents or hazardous driving conditions.The guidance can be set to either 'normal', 'avoid toll roads' or 'avoid toll roads (shortest)'. I can't say that I saw a big difference between the three on local trips, within 50-100 miles from my residence. Sometimes, simply making a left turn rather than a right turn can shorten a trip by many miles, which makes me believe that the stored map does not have very good information on which roads can be engaged through a left turn vs. divided highways. While I do see this something that needs to be addressed by future firmware or map upgrades, I do not consider it as a big disqualifier. I am relying on my GPS to help me find my way back when I get lost, to take me to unfamiliar places and to help me plan long trips and to find my way while away from home and this device seems to be capable of doing all of the above even though not always in the most optimal fashion.Interestingly, the manual claims that, while driving through a tunnel or through an area of poor satellite reception, the device can sense motion and continue to display your approximate position. I am not sure if this is a unique feature and I was not able to test it myself, absent tunnels in my immediate vicinity.Many other features and settings are available but I will have to limit the size of this review. I will try to answer any questions that I can answer to anyone who leaves as comment, as soon as I see it.As a sound device for a phone-----------------------------When paired with a phone, the NVU83T can be used a speaker for the paired phone(s), to answer incoming calls by simply touching the screen or to initiate calls, including 'calling home' by simply drawing a 'v' on the screen.It can be paired with several phones, it can import phone books directly from the phones, stores the last 40 numbers dialed or incoming and there allows for setting the volume and the level of noise/echo cancelling.Rating------I will rate the NVU83T as a 4-star. The sheer volume of features and capabilities and the level of customization - to which the review above is only a hint - go a long way toward making up for the sometimes imperfect guidance. I want to make it clear: never did the NVU83T send me to the wrong place or asked me to do anything dangerous - like making a U-turn on a highway. Its directions are not always the best but neither seem to be those from competing products so, relatively speaking, the NVU83T holds its own and it offers some features not always found in other models.","[6, 6]",Not perfect but comparable and in many aspects better than the competition,2009,03, 10,1.0,5994,1057,Positive,6,6,0,0.022602182055039895,20090310

It makes playing games such as GT5-Prologue a lot more fun than playing them with the 'regular' PS3 controllers. For the more arcade-like games, I don't know. I see that my kids prefer the six-axis, probably because they are light and wireless.Let me list my biggest complains first:- WIRES: there's a wire from the wheel to the power brick, then a wire from the power brick to the electric outlet. Then, you have a wire from the pedals platform to the wheel body. Then, there's a wire from the wheel to the PS3. I wish that 2 of these were replaced by 'wireless'.- THE WHEEL BOOTUP: whenever you start your PS3 or your game, the wheel initializes itself but quickly turning right and left. The moves have so much force, they COULD injure a little kid's arm if it happened to be caught by the wheel moving.- GRIP TO TABLE: it's not TOO BAD but, from time to time, the wheel goes off whatever platform you attach it to.- GRIP TO FLOOR: there is some rough thing at the bottom that does prevent the pedals platform from slipping and moving but it's not perfect.What I appreciated the most:- CONTROL: it's perfect. It's well calibrated, balanced and precise.- RUMBLING/SHAKING/VIBRATING: this is AWESOME. On GT5 you can FEEL the road, you feel the bumps and you must fight the wheel when taking high speed turns.- OVERALL CONSTRUCTION: it feels solid, well-manufactured, durable.Things lacking that I don't miss but some might:- NO CLUTCH PEDAL: it's not there- THE STICK: shifting is not exactly imitating life. You basically move it up to move into a higher gear and down to go to the lower gear. That's it.Why do I give it 4 stars and no 3? BECAUSE IT'S FUN! Well worth the price - and it's coming from someone who tends to avoid Logitech stuff (long story).My next purchase should be one of them driving seats. That would take care of some of my biggest issues I have with the wheel in its present setup - attached to a coffee table.","[2, 2]",Great with GT5 (prologue) but... so many wires...,2008,09, 18,1.0,2028,367,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20080918

Dent ""Aragorn""",1242086400,5.0,B00165XQWW,"05 12, 2009","THE QUICK EVALUATIONThe Nano offers the convenience of cordless mouse operation to any computer (laptop OR desktop) that can spare a USB port. It performs flawlessly on any solid surface I've tested it so far. Its size is a little smaller than what I would consider a 'regular' size mouse.Other notable features include: quick and easy plug-and-play setup (no disk), 1 year+ claimed battery life, the ability to mount a hook on a laptop lid to dock the mouse, extended features and customization can be achieved by downloading and installing Logitech software.If what you need is a cordless mouse, it can't get much better than this._________________________________________________________________THE EXTENDED EVALUATIONContents:---------What you get is the mouse itself, the small receiver that plugs into a USB port, a customized USB extension wire that allows you to have the receiver on the desk if the mouse is used with a desktop computer, 2 AA batteries, a mouse docking kit so that the mouse can be carried with the laptop and a glossy, multiple-languages setup/troubleshooting/dock mounting-removing quick reference sheet. There's also a small tin case that includes the mouse dock mounting/removal kit.Mechanics/ergonomics:---------------------As I stated above, the mouse is a bit smaller than 'normal' size. It feels smallish in my hands (I am 6'2"") but it may feel just right to most users. Form-wise, it's as perfect as it can be for a 2-button/wheeled mouse.A plastic overlay (the black part in the silver and black mouse) can be easily removed to allow for batteries insertion and, surprisingly, to allow for the storage of the small USB receiver inside the mouse body when not plugged into the computer.The mouse is expected to turn itself off when 'on the hook'. I did not install the dock and I can't tell whether it would reliably turn itself back on when off the hook. For those like me who don't care about the docking option, there is an on/off button on the bottom of the mouse. A small LED shows when the mouse is on by turning itself on.The scroll wheel should offer the capability of adjusting the scrolling speed. I confess that I could not tell the difference. The up/down scrolling seemed to be 'quick' before and after pressing down on the wheel.I tested the wireless capabilities with the mouse up to 20 feet away from the computer and the mouse operated as expected. Given that the mouse communicates with the USB receiver through radio waves (line of sight not needed) it is not clear to me why the USB extension cord is provided.Logitech is very proud for providing the ability to dock the mouse on a laptop's lid. I did not take advantage of this feature and I am not planning to do so in the future. If interested in this feature, I suggest that you check other reviews that discuss it.Customization:--------------I STRONGLY recommend that all who purchased this mouse goes to the Logitech site (it's Logitech dot com slash download) and install the SetPoint software. SetPoint adds A LOT of functionality. By the way, anyone can download the software - no need to actually have a mouse - so, if you want to see what you can do with your mouse before actually buying it, do install SetPoint and see what's available. Briefly, these are the advantages of SetPoint running on your computer - again, I am using the mouse on a Vista Enterprise laptop and some features may be specific to this operating system.- Swap the 2 buttons- The little button behind the scroll wheel that's inactive without SetPoint can be used to switch applications (see the image I posted for Vista), as a third button, zoom, auto-scroll, play/pause, mute, a specific keystroke assignment...- Tilting the scroll wheel right/left would do left/right scroll by default but it can be set to back/forward, previous/next, cruise up/down, even to specific keystroke assignments. Oh, and these can be done for 'all apps' or specific settings can be applied to an expandable list of specific applications - i posted an image showing the buttons setup first screen.- Mouse movement can be customized for speed, acceleration, pointer trails and so on.- A special 'gaming' setup is available and there is a 'game detection' option that can be activated - see the image I posted, showing the 'gaming' setup screen.- Scrolling can be customized for acceleration on the vertical and horizontal AND for specific applications, if desired.- SetPoint can also show the battery charge level. Right now, it claims that my battery is going to last for another 547 days. We shall see.One note for Vista users. Once installed, SetPoint does NOT run by simply clicking on it. To run it, you must right-click and pick 'run as administrator'.Conclusion:-----------This is a wireless mouse well-suited for either a laptop or a desktop computer. I am VERY happy with it and, in fact, I'm not the only one in our household who feels this way :) - it may end up with one of my kids, eventually. The positives for this mouse are:- Trouble-free operation.- Easy initial setup.- Customizable and feature-rich.- Well designed.As far as 'concerns' - and they are not necessarily 'negatives':- It should be understood that this is NOT a Bluetooth device. Not being a Bluetooth device makes the setup and moving from one computer to another a lot easier (no need for pairing) but the receiver WILL take over a USB port so one should be mindful of this.- The USB receiver small size makes it convenient for using it with laptops but it also increases the risks that one might lose it. The 'storage inside the mouse' when not in use is 'a solution' and it may reduce the risks of losing it but not everyone may feel comfortable with taking their mouse apart repeatedly.- The on/off button on the bottom of the mouse is an interesting solution but, I bet, I will not always remember to turn off my mouse after done with using it - in fact, I just realized that I've had the mouse on since this morning.- I still don't understand the need for the USB extension chord but, it's just an extra. It does not hurt anything._____________________________________Note: I do understand the need for the USB extension chord now. This is a good thing. If someone wants to use the mouse on a laptop AND on a desktop and the desktop's USB ports are located at the back of the desktop, the extension chord provides the convenience of easily moving the little radio receiver from the desktop to the laptop without having to crawl under the desk every time one wants to move it. This is VERY useful, absent a USB port multiplexer and it was very thoughtful of Logitech to provide it._____________________________________Overall, this is a 4.75 star product that easily rounds up to a 5-star.","[26, 26]","Impressive, well-performing, feature-rich cordless mouse",2009,05, 12,1.0,6745,1139,Positive,26,26,0,0.023253541768441622,20090512

It's as simple as plugging it in and inserting a memory card or a USB drive in the back.For fine-tuning, the touch border menu system (NEVER TOUCH THE SCREEN) will let you customize your slide shows by selecting:- the time each picture is displayed - from 5 seconds to one hour- the sort order (A-Z, Z-A, newest to oldest or vice-versa)- orientation - portrait or landscape- the source for your pictures - internal memory, or one of the 3 (THREE) external memory portsPhysically, your frame can sit on its stands that rotates 90 degrees to allow for either portrait or landscape or you can use the mounting holes to hang it on a wall. The 2 provided mattes are easy to attach and more can be purchased from Kodak.In addition to displaying pictures and playing videos, the frame can be also used to play music.Besides slide shows, it's possible to display one specific picture by selecting it from a display mode of thumbnails.FEATURESThe most important parameter is, of course, the display and it's a bright, crisp, , fast, 800x480.Kodak has built a lots of features into this frame, some most welcome, others not exactly needed. The most impressive is the frame's ability to accept just about any memory card in existence. There are 3 slots in the back:- SD, MMC, MS, xD- CF, MD- USBIn addition, you can connect to a computer and load the frame's own tiny 128 MB internal memory.Since you can have 'something' in each of the three slots at any given time, you could load this frame with, literally, tens of thousands of pictures if you so desire - slide shows will only look at one port at a time but you can switch any time you want.Not likely to be used much, the frame does allow you to copy files between the various ports or from a camera/computer, you can magnify a picture, rotate it, save slide shows, print a picture and so on.The EasyShare software lets you organize, print, and share your pictures. It's nice that it was in the box but I am not likely to use it - it's available as a free download, by the way.MY RATINGSince all I wanted was a picture frame that displays pictures with bright colors without distorting the original, the M820 fully meets my expectations.I appreciate its ability to take inputs from so many different sources - I currently have an inexpensiveHP 8 GB Class 4 SDHC Flash Memory Card Q6276A-EFwith over 1000 pictures on it, cycling them at a rate of one every 30 seconds. I also like the 'real picture frame' look and feel, with the nice mattes included. I don't have much use for the 'extra' features having to do with file management or music playing but them being there doesn't hurt. The border touch interface is not always as responsive as it could be but, once a slide show is set, the frame is likely to keep working for many days before there's any need of controls so this is not a big demerit.The M820 is an easy 5-star because I am impressed and so is the rest of the family and so are friends who invariably ask me the 2 questions: where I got it from and for how much :).","[4, 4]",It's all superlatives where it matters,2010,03, 22,1.0,3752,667,Positive,4,4,0,0.022537046083699722,20100322

The spinning DVD has 2 little holes that, according to the makers, cause enough turbulence to remove dust off the lens. I have no way of proving that it's true but I am quite confident that there's no way this could actually make things worse and hope that it is, in fact, effective.In addition to the 2-minute, no-scratch cleaning cycle, the DVD includes a couple of useful extras. You can verify that your speakers work, that you didn't reverse the polarity, that your speakers can play high and low frequency (or maybe it's a test of your ear hearing them). There's even some relaxation music.Overall, I am pleased with this product.

The part that plugs into your computer's USB port slides in and out of the protective casing and you ergonomically control it with your thumb.

It's not the 'perfect' USB drive - there are larger, speedier drives and see the 'minuses' listed above but its good features are good enough to make me 'love it' which is Amazon's standard for 5 stars._____________________________________NOTE:The drive comes with SanDisk's U3 Launchpad installed. This is an 'old' technology meant to facilitate the launching of Windows apps of a flash drive. It allowed U3-compliant apps to temporarily write to your computer's registry... probably not a well-thought method. SanDisk considers U3 'dead' at this time but you are likely to find the 'Launchpad' on the USB drive. The best way to completely remove it is via a SanDisk-supplied tool - I will post a comment with the URL. Once that is done, Windows 7 allowed me to format the drive as either FAT32, NTFS or exFAT._____________________________________","[1, 1]","Speedy, large storage, physically small",2011,03, 5,1.0,2198,364,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20110305

The expensive brand presentation simply enumerates the HDMI 1.3 specs as if it being HDMI 1.3 compliant was a really big deal. It is not a big deal. Even a cable that costs 95% less is HDMI 1.3 compliant.My suggestion: if you think that the proponents of the expensive brand have a point when they claim that their product is a lot more durable, buy TWO Media Bridge wires and still pay almost 80% less than you would pay for one of the expensive ones.My personal experience: I've never paid 'a lot' for an HDMI cable because it makes no sense to pay more.

I can't think of any major issues and the only minor ones are the orange light that glows every time the disk is accessed - yes, we know, data is being read or written to the disk by the computer - and the external power supply.Overall impressions: easy to install. I just plugged it in and... that was it on my Windows machine. The unit comes with some backup software but I like to be in control myself so I can't say that I bothered testing it.

In fact, my only regret is not buying it from Amazon because, it turns out, I paid too much for it elsewhere back then. It's also possible that the price went down since I ordered it.To conclude: if you have a relatively large amount of data to back up, or if you want to store pictures AND some videos, then this is what you need. If all you need is to back up your 10,000 pictures family album, you can get away with a smaller drive but, given the price... why would you not buy this one?

As I write this review, I am sitting here, on the US East Coast, listening to some Icelandic rock station. In the past couple of hours I browsed through radio stations based in France, the Philippines, UK and, I believe Thailand. Pretty cool, eh?But, let's summarize:Installation: super-easy. You stick the USB thing into the proper port and you get prompted to allow for the software to install on your computer - at least that's what Vista does.Interface: you get 2 top-10 lists that can be expanded to top-100, by region or by genre. The tops are not too useful, unless you really believe that the number one talk station in the world is broadcasting from Bulgaria but, it's fun to have them there. The categories are usually hit and miss - you are almost as likely to find music on a 'talk' station as your are to find actual talk but... it's no big deal, believe me. The stations are also classified by Genre and Location and, within each of these, you can sort them by 'country' - not all stations have a country assigned to them and Kansas and Kenya are both viewed as 'countries'. You can include individual stations on your favorite list and you can vote them up or down. There is also a 'history' section, a 'help' section and a link to the maker of the product. Oh, the bottom of the window is reserved for advertising but, I bet, you are NOT likely to stare at the Aluratek windows while listening to the radio so it's not bothersome.Reception: each station shows a number of bars, telephone style - 4 bars are supposed to be the clearest and no bars you probably can't get. The quality of your connection is, without a doubt, dependent of your own bandwidth. Depending of it and depending on many other factors, your connection may break from time to time or you may not be able to connect at all but, so far, I am happy with what I get.Why I almost took out 1 star?- The interface could be improved. What I definitely miss is the ability to enter my own little notes to the stations that I mark as 'favorites'. The way they appear now - which could be something like 'WKZR' or maybe a string of Chinese hieroglyphs - is not always descriptive enough.To summarize: if you spend a few hundred $$ for your laptop, I can't think of any good justification for not spending $20-30 on this little device.______________________________October 2, 2008 UpdateI learned from a related discussion thread that there are 'free' sites that allow access to thousands of radio stations with some search capabilities. [...]  is one of them. Some may prefer to use such a site for their radio listening and save some money.

Life is good again and I am happy I made this purchase because I really like the Uniden set and didn't want to replace it just because of exhausted batteries.___________________________________TWO notes of caution:- When compared to the original BT-1011, the specs are slightly different. While they are both 2.4V, Nickel Metal Hydride (NI-MH), my original BT-1011 are labeled 650mAh while these are 800mAh. This seems to be okay.

To my surprise - I expected some glitches - I had close to zero problem installing and operating it. Here is my experience.- I followed the advice to first run the installation off the provided CD.- Even though all of my computers are wireless, I followed the advice and connected one of my computer to the router via Ethernet to perform the initial installation.- After disconnecting the old 801.11b router I used the exact same name for the new network. This allowed for all devices to connect immediately, as soon as the setup completed.- I made sure that the DHCP server was on.- The end of setup. All devices, including the wireless printer and the VOIP box connected without a problem.To my surprise, LELA is not on the CD. It took me longer to find, download and install LELA (Linksys EasyLink Advisor) than to complete the initial setup. I strongly recommend that you do install LELA because, besides the nice graphic of your home network it allows you to restore broken connections without having to turn off the router.As far as performance is concerned, I believe that I notice a slight but not significant improvement over my old 801.11b router. We have about one dozen connected devices: desktops, laptops, a PS3, a PSP, VOIP, printer and, with all on, everything worked just fine. With the router in the basement, I had '3-bars' on a computer 15-20 feet from the router. Surprisingly, I had 3 bars on the first and on the second floor as well and I had the same 3 bars outside, about 90 feet from the router, by the pool. The old router gave me 4 bars in the basement but only 3 bars in the rest of the house and only 1 or 2 bars with intermittent disconnections outside the house.With LELA running, I was able to quickly fix the the few disconnections that occurred over a several-days period without having to power off the router. This was better than my old 801.11b that had me power off the cable modem and the router whenever the connection to the Internet stopped working. Disconnections do occur after computers are set to 'sleep' but recovery is usually quick when the computer wakes up. I never had issues with non-computer devices such as printer, PS3 or the VOIP box.Overall, I am very happy with my new router so far. It's probably as good as any 801.11g device can get.___________________________________________DNS issues update:With DHCP, strangely, after a few months of operation, the router began to 'forget' about passing DNS queries to the outside server. It KNOWS about the 3 DNS servers the ISP has but, out of the blue I get 'resolving host' errors and LELA claims that I'm no longer connected to the Internet. This while VoIP, connected to the same router works without a problem and so do the PS3 and my kids computers.The initial 'solution' was to power off the router and then power it back on.I have no idea why this was happening yet but, this is my quick solution: on the 'Network and Sharing Center' click on your connection 'View status' then 'Properties', highlight 'Internet Protocol Version 4...', 'Properties', 'Advanced', from the DNS tab click on 'Add...' and enter all the DNS servers that your router has listed under 'Status'.This eliminated all problems.","[20, 21]","Easy setup, near trouble-free operation, happy overall.

I believe they used to be expensive too.This is my first and voice recorder and it seems to address most of my issues back then. The Olympus VN-5000 DVR's notable features include:- no moving parts other than the several buttons- small- long battery life- no physical recording media needed other than its own physical memory- moderately easy to learn controls- 3 level of recording quality and, depending in the quality selected- 20, 50 or 300 hours of recording time, depending on the selected recording quality- voice activated recording- variable playback speed- date/time stamps on files- some rudimentary file management (4 preset folders, files can be moved between folders)- etc., etc.Its main weakness is its not allowing for easy transfer of records files - see note at the bottom on how to do it 'the hard way'.Overall, this model is a trade off between low price/simplicity and features/flexibility in favor of low price and simplicity. Being my fist DVR, I happen to like it this way but the more sophisticated or the more demanding users may not not appreciate its awkward file management and the fact that, at least in theory, it's impossible to get the files out of the device, into some other form of storage (but it can be done - see note below).I am very pleased with this device. Between 4 and 5 stars, I decided on 4 because this inexpensive, 'entry level' gadget, while making recording easy, is not as good at managing and retrieving the information once recorded, especially when one stores many files._______________________________________Note:If you want to transfer your files to a computer, it can be done but it can be a time-consuming process. To do so, you need to- Install Audacity on your machine (it's a free download).- Plug a microphone cable into your DVR's headphone slot and the other end into your computer's microphone interface - all computers should have these wires and you can use either the 'green' or the 'pink' one.- Set Audacity on 'record' and you simply 'play' your file.- Test for the proper volume setting before recording a long file.- Save your recording as a WAV or MP3 file.It's going to take as long as it took you to make the recording but, once it's done you have a file that you can do with as you please.","[2, 2]",Simple but effective 'first' DVR,2009,04, 19,1.0,2599,446,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20090419

It performs flawlessly on any solid surface I've tested it so far. Its size is a little smaller than what I would consider a 'regular' size mouse.Other notable features include: quick and easy plug-and-play setup (no disk), 1 year+ claimed battery life, the ability to mount a hook on a laptop lid to dock the mouse, extended features and customization can be achieved by downloading and installing Logitech software.If what you need is a cordless mouse, it can't get much better than this._________________________________________________________________THE EXTENDED EVALUATIONContents:---------What you get is the mouse itself, the small receiver that plugs into a USB port, a customized USB extension wire that allows you to have the receiver on the desk if the mouse is used with a desktop computer, 2 AA batteries, a mouse docking kit so that the mouse can be carried with the laptop and a glossy, multiple-languages setup/troubleshooting/dock mounting-removing quick reference sheet. There's also a small tin case that includes the mouse dock mounting/removal kit.Mechanics/ergonomics:---------------------As I stated above, the mouse is a bit smaller than 'normal' size. It feels smallish in my hands (I am 6'2"") but it may feel just right to most users. Form-wise, it's as perfect as it can be for a 2-button/wheeled mouse.A plastic overlay (the black part in the silver and black mouse) can be easily removed to allow for batteries insertion and, surprisingly, to allow for the storage of the small USB receiver inside the mouse body when not plugged into the computer.The mouse is expected to turn itself off when 'on the hook'. I did not install the dock and I can't tell whether it would reliably turn itself back on when off the hook. For those like me who don't care about the docking option, there is an on/off button on the bottom of the mouse. A small LED shows when the mouse is on by turning itself on.The scroll wheel should offer the capability of adjusting the scrolling speed. I confess that I could not tell the difference. The up/down scrolling seemed to be 'quick' before and after pressing down on the wheel.I tested the wireless capabilities with the mouse up to 20 feet away from the computer and the mouse operated as expected. Given that the mouse communicates with the USB receiver through radio waves (line of sight not needed) it is not clear to me why the USB extension cord is provided.Logitech is very proud for providing the ability to dock the mouse on a laptop's lid. I did not take advantage of this feature and I am not planning to do so in the future. If interested in this feature, I suggest that you check other reviews that discuss it.Customization:--------------I STRONGLY recommend that all who purchased this mouse goes to the Logitech site (it's Logitech dot com slash download) and install the SetPoint software. SetPoint adds A LOT of functionality. By the way, anyone can download the software - no need to actually have a mouse - so, if you want to see what you can do with your mouse before actually buying it, do install SetPoint and see what's available. Briefly, these are the advantages of SetPoint running on your computer - again, I am using the mouse on a Vista Enterprise laptop and some features may be specific to this operating system.- Swap the 2 buttons- The little button behind the scroll wheel that's inactive without SetPoint can be used to switch applications (see the image I posted for Vista), as a third button, zoom, auto-scroll, play/pause, mute, a specific keystroke assignment...- Tilting the scroll wheel right/left would do left/right scroll by default but it can be set to back/forward, previous/next, cruise up/down, even to specific keystroke assignments. Oh, and these can be done for 'all apps' or specific settings can be applied to an expandable list of specific applications - i posted an image showing the buttons setup first screen.- Mouse movement can be customized for speed, acceleration, pointer trails and so on.- A special 'gaming' setup is available and there is a 'game detection' option that can be activated - see the image I posted, showing the 'gaming' setup screen.- Scrolling can be customized for acceleration on the vertical and horizontal AND for specific applications, if desired.- SetPoint can also show the battery charge level. Right now, it claims that my battery is going to last for another 547 days. We shall see.One note for Vista users. Once installed, SetPoint does NOT run by simply clicking on it. To run it, you must right-click and pick 'run as administrator'.Conclusion:-----------This is a wireless mouse well-suited for either a laptop or a desktop computer. I am VERY happy with it and, in fact, I'm not the only one in our household who feels this way :) - it may end up with one of my kids, eventually. The positives for this mouse are:- Trouble-free operation.- Easy initial setup.- Customizable and feature-rich.- Well designed.As far as 'concerns' - and they are not necessarily 'negatives':- It should be understood that this is NOT a Bluetooth device. Not being a Bluetooth device makes the setup and moving from one computer to another a lot easier (no need for pairing) but the receiver WILL take over a USB port so one should be mindful of this.- The USB receiver small size makes it convenient for using it with laptops but it also increases the risks that one might lose it. The 'storage inside the mouse' when not in use is 'a solution' and it may reduce the risks of losing it but not everyone may feel comfortable with taking their mouse apart repeatedly.- The on/off button on the bottom of the mouse is an interesting solution but, I bet, I will not always remember to turn off my mouse after done with using it - in fact, I just realized that I've had the mouse on since this morning.- I still don't understand the need for the USB extension chord but, it's just an extra. It does not hurt anything._____________________________________Note: I do understand the need for the USB extension chord now. As esanta notes - see the third comment to this review - this is a good thing. If someone wants to use the mouse on a laptop AND on a desktop and the desktop's USB ports are located at the back of the desktop, the extension chord provides the convenience of easily moving the little radio receiver from the desktop to the laptop without having to crawl under the desk every time one wants to move it. This is VERY useful, absent a USB port multiplexer and it was very thoughtful of Logitech to provide it._____________________________________Overall, this is a 4.75 star product that easily rounds up to a 5-star.","[9, 11]","An impressive, well-performing, feature-rich cordless mouse",2009,02, 28,0.8181818181818182,6802,1151,Positive,9,11,2,0.022634750040709983,20090228

In my case, it fulfills the task assigned - stores a large number of songs for theSanDisk Sansa Clip+ 2 GB MP3 Playerthat accepts microSDHC cards. However, its relatively low data transfer speed may NOT make it a good pick if the intended use was in a camera that takes 'rapid fire' shots.PERFORMANCEI would like to note that I did not test the card with a camera but its stated 'Class 4' speed class, which is the equivalent of a 26x speed rating should guarantee a MINIMUM of 4MB/s - more than enough when it comes to music playback.Unlike the 'x' ratings, the speed class ratings are NOT certified by an independent body so, more or less, you will have to decide whether you trust the card's maker - HP is quite a reputable brand and it so happens that I DID test the card myself. I found that I could copy 2 GB worth of songs in about 6-7 minutes. This is about 4-5MB/s for writing on the card for the first time, indicating that the Class 4/26x claim is honest. This is very good performance for a 'class 4' given that the card was inserted into an 'full' SDHC card adapter which, in turn, was inserted into a USB card reader.Practically, if you are going to use this card in a camera, depending on the quality of the pics you are taking, you may or may not be happy with its performance. At 12 megapixels, a 100% quality JPG would produce a 2-3 MB or loarger file so, without even counting the overhead, your camera will spend about half second, possibly more to write to the card which may or may not be in line with your own expectation. For better performance, look for a higher 'class' number 133x/Class 20, for example, should support 20 MB/s or writing up to 10 12-megapixel JPG photo files per second.ADDITIONAL FEATURES/CONCERNSThe card comes with a 'full' SDHC adapter. This is very important, especially if you need to interface with a computer. In my case, I am inserting the microSDHC into the included SDHC adapter which, in turn, goes into a USB card reader - I used the one that came with theTranscend 16 GB Class 2 SDHC Flash Memory Card with USB Card Reader TS16GSDHC2-P2.The card comes formatted as FAT32 and my Windows 7 computer was able to write to it and read from it without difficulty. If, for whatever reason, FAT32 is not what you need, you should be able to format it under Windows/Vista, Mac or Unix/Linux to whatever you may need. The MP3 player was able to read the card as formatted without any issues.Not ALL cameras support FAT32. Older cameras may only be aware of FAT16 and can't see any card larger that 4GB. If in doubt, check with the manufacturer or maybe read your camera's reviews at Amazon.Related to the above - anyone who may have a device meant to use SD cards should be aware that SDHC may not work with it so it's better to ask the maker.While the SDHC interface is provided, I would go for a full-size SDHC card if that's what my gadget accepted. You can use the card with the adapter but why bother. The microSDHC being so small and fragile, why risk losing it or breaking it?RATINGThis is a honestly rated Class 4 card. It works very well for me in my MP3 player but I'd look for a faster card if I needed a card for a camera or a camcorder. Class 4, as I explained, means relatively SLOW so, if blazing-fast write speed is not an issue, this is probably what you need given the price and the maker's reputation - by the way, the card is manufactured in Taiwan.For what it is, the card deserves 5 stars.","[1, 1]","Good value, reputable maker",2010,04, 18,1.0,3589,663,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20100418

The claim is that, if you do this, you won't have to take your laptop out of the case and, therefore, if you buy this case you buy some convenience. The sad reality is that I was always asked to take my laptop out of the case at airport security points and, most of the time, I was asked to actually turn it on. In two instances, the airport detectives actually took my laptop and inserted it inside a machine supposedly capable to detect minute traces of certain substances so, Zip-Thru doesn't do much, given the current airport security practices and circumstances. I can't see any good use for this feature.The so-called life-time warranty seems to be nothing else but a promise to replace the bag if found defective - ""if after inspection we find that the product was defective in materials or workmanship"". This is nice but it would be illegal not to. Amazon would take back a defective product anyway so the 'lifetime warranty' doesn't mean much.Overall, I will grant this product 5 stars. It gets a slight demerit for the two somewhat misleading marketing gimmicks but it still deserves 5 stars.________________________________________________2013 update: this continues to be my primary laptop bag.","[6, 7]","Nice laptop case, claims of security check convenience slightly exaggerated",2009,07, 4,0.8571428571428571,2400,391,Positive,6,7,1,0.02256961406936981,20090704

Its size and shape makes it perfect for smaller hands but, even though the long time user is going to be my 12 yr. old guy, I didn't experience any major discomfort while using it myself for the past couple of days.ERGONOMICSMicrosoft's claim that the Mini will work on almost any surface appear to be true. The mouse performed very well on a regular pad, on a polished wood desk, on granite and on the very dark titanium top of my laptop. Performance was acceptable on my jeans but, when lifted up in the air strange things may happen.As I stated already, this mouse was named 'Mini' for a reason. It's not minuscule, like the little USB devices that are found in cheap 'laptop and travel' kits but it's significantly smaller than a 'full size' mouse: less than 4"" in length, about 2.5"" at its widest. The shape is nicely sculpted to allow for a comfortable grip with your thumb and and your middle finger.Given that there are two extra buttons that are supposed to be operated with the thumb and to its overall asymmetric shape, this mouse is specifically designed for RIGHT-HAND use. I do not know if a left-handed version is available.As far as buttons are concerned, besides the 2 expected right/left buttons, and the scroll wheel, you also get 2 additional buttons on the left side, operated with the thumb. By default, the button close to the tip of the mouse will magnify when pressed while the other button can be used to 'go back'. The scroll wheel will do the normal up/down scroll but it could also scroll left/right when nudged that way with your index finger and clicking on it can be configured to perform some other function - the default seems to invoke the 'flip 3D - switch between windows' function in Vista.The top surface is mostly shiny plastic but the right side is a ruberrized texture for a better grip.The transceiver and be snapped into the bottom of the mouse which will turn it off completely as opposed to it just 'sleeping' when not in use. For transportation or long-term storage a balck velvety 'pocket' comes with the mouse.Finally, just for show and to impress those who may be watching, the mouse glows a bright blue from underneath for a fews seconds when picked up after a period of 'sleep'.CUSTOMIZATIONThe Mini can be used 'as is' - plug the transceiver in an USB port and start using it - or it can be enhanced and customized with Microsoft's IntelliPoint app, used to configure nearly all of Microsoft's pointing devices as well as others - it recognized my ThinkPad's UltraNav TouchPoint device, for example.Through IntelliPoint it's possible to customize each of the 4 buttons and the scroll wheel, pick your favorite pointers and the way they behave and so on. I will post a couple of IntelliPoint screenshots.INSTALLATION, OPERATIONAs I stated already, the mouse is ready to use even without software installation.Once you insert the AA battery (provided) and plug the transceiver into a USB port, you are in business. Software installation off the provided CD is a matter of additional minutes.As far as I can tell, there's no way to check the battery status and the only way to actually turn the mouse off is by snapping in the transceiver - there is no on/off button or switch. The mouse appears to be going to sleep if not used for a minute or so and it will wake up quickly when moved. There are no statements on expected battery life but, given that all you need is a cheap AA, this is not a major concern.It's probably worth noting that the transceiver operates at 2.4 GHz. I didn't notice any interference with anything around.Microsoft claims that the Mini should work on computers running Microsoft Vista/XP or Mac OS X v 10.2x-10.5x. I only tested it on XP and Vista.PACKAGINGBe very careful when taking the mouse out of its package because you may get a plastic cut which is not unlike a paper cut. Unless my copy was atypical, this is one example of bad, careless and frustrating, bordering to unacceptable. Besides the sharp plastic edges that had to be dealt with, the thin multi-language manual looked already 'used' and - I couldn't believe it - the software CD was there 'naked', unprotected and already scratched with little bits of the carton electro-statically attached to the surface. I don't know who does quality control for this product but, hopefully, mine was only one bad example, not the norm.MY RATINGI am very pleased with this mouse operation and I would have kept it if my hands were smaller. Any right-handed person who doesn't have big hands should find the Mini a good choice for a wireless mouse. This would have been a 5-stars but I will take away one for the packaging which bordered on unacceptable. I simply couldn't imagine that MICROSOFT, a SOFTWARE company would agree to have a CD holding Microsoft's own software thrown into the box, vulnerable to dirt and scratches.","[4, 4]",Excellent - if you are right-handed and your hands are small,2010,02, 19,1.0,5147,901,Positive,4,4,0,0.022537046083699722,20100219

It's as simple as plugging it in and inserting a memory card or a USB drive in the back.For fine-tuning, the touch border menu system (NEVER TOUCH THE SCREEN) will let you customize your slide shows by selecting:- the time each picture is displayed - from 5 seconds to one hour- the sort order (A-Z, Z-A, newest to oldest or vice-versa)- orientation - portrait or landscape- the source for your pictures - internal memory, or one of the 3 (THREE) external memory portsPhysically, your frame can sit on its stands that rotates 90 degrees to allow for either portrait or landscape or you can use the mounting holes to hang it on a wall. The 2 provided mattes are easy to attach and more can be purchased from Kodak.In addition to displaying pictures and playing videos, the frame can be also used to play music.Besides slide shows, it's possible to display one specific picture by selecting it from a display mode of thumbnails.FEATURESThe most important parameter is, of course, the display and it's a bright, crisp, , fast, 800x480.Kodak has built a lots of features into this frame, some most welcome, others not exactly needed. The most impressive is the frame's ability to accept just about any memory card in existence. There are 3 slots in the back:- SD, MMC, MS, xD- CF, MD- USBIn addition, you can connect to a computer and load the frame's own tiny 128 MB internal memory.Since you can have 'something' in each of the three slots at any given time, you could load this frame with, literally, tens of thousands of pictures if you so desire - slide shows will only look at one port at a time but you can switch any time you want.Not likely to be used much, the frame does allow you to copy files between the various ports or from a camera/computer, you can magnify a picture, rotate it, save slide shows, print a picture and so on.The EasyShare software lets you organize, print, and share your pictures. It's nice that it was in the box but I am not likely to use it - it's available as a free download, by the way.MY RATINGSince all I wanted was a picture frame that displays pictures with bright colors without distorting the original, the M820 fully meets my expectations.I appreciate its ability to take inputs from so many different sources - I currently have an inexpensiveHP 8 GB Class 4 SDHC Flash Memory Card Q6276A-EFwith over 1000 pictures on it, cycling them at a rate of one every 30 seconds. I also like the 'real picture frame' look and feel, with the nice mattes included. I don't have much use for the 'extra' features having to do with file management or music playing but them being there doesn't hurt. The border touch interface is not always as responsive as it could be but, once a slide show is set, the frame is likely to keep working for many days before there's any need of controls so this is not a big demerit.The M820 is an easy 5-star because I am impressed and so is the rest of the family and so are friends who invariably ask me the 2 questions: where I got it from and for how much :).","[2, 2]",It's all superlatives where it matters,2010,03, 21,1.0,3762,668,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20100321

It was easy to get coverage and the company seems to be an honest player.THE PURCHASE EXPERIENCEGetting the warranty was relatively easy, especially now that I have an account. I had a few questions the first time around but, to my surprise, the off-shore persons answering the phone seemed alert and were able to come up with intelligent and helpful answers without keeping me on hold forever.Shortly after I completed the transaction I received an email from SquareTrade that had a printable copy of the service agreement/contract. The first time, I was told over the phone that I had to get a userID/password at their site in order to be able to manage my coverage information. Once that completed, I was able to log in and retrieve my contract number and instructions on how to send SquareTrade my proof of purchase - if it's something you bought from Amazon, simply paste Amazon's invoice into an email that has the contract number in the subject line. SquareTrade then sends you an email that acknowledges receipt and advising you to keep the original proof because they don't actually verify it until they get the first claim.COVERAGEIt may be interesting to understand how coverage works without spending time on the phone with the company reps so, here it is.- There is a 60-day full refund upon cancellation provision so, if you don't like the service agreement, it's easy to cancel.- This coverage is concurrent with the manufacturer's warranty. In other words, this 3-year coverage begins on the day you sign for it but SquareTrade won't be taking claims from you while the manufacturer's warranty is still in effect. If your manufacturer has a one-year warranty, SquareTrade will cover it for years 2 and 3.- The value of coverage is limited to whatever you paid for item. This is important so, let me provide the full quote from the agreement:[The total amount that We will pay for repairs or replacement made in connection with all claims that You make pursuant to this Service Agreement shall not exceed the purchase price of the Product, less taxes. In the event that We make payments for repairs, which in the aggregate, are equal to the purchase price or replace the Product with a new, rebuilt or refurbished product of equal or similar features and functionality, We will have no further obligations under this Service Agreement.]- There is a 'no lemon' provision in the agreement which states that if the same item is repaired 3 times for the same defect within a year they will replace your TV with an equivalent product, at which time the warranty coverage ends - will not cover the replacement.- If your item is damaged by a power surge - while charging - and you had a power surge protector they may ask you to send it over to them for examination (probably to see if they can get some money from the power surge protector manufacturer).- Any time we are talking about replacements, they reserve the right to ask for the defective item to be sent to them and they will provide the box and the shipping label.- They do not cover scratches or cracks - they have a more expensive warranty product for that.- They do not cover any damage caused by you doing terrible things to your camera - like leaving it out in the rain, assuming it's not water-proof.- There is no deductible.- They will allow for the agreement to be transferred if you sell your camera - can do it at their Web site.MY RATINGI haven't made any claim yet but, since Amazon stands behind this company and based on the service agreement and on my experience in dealing with the people at the call center, I am confident that this is a company worth doing business with so they get a 5-star.","[1, 1]",Worth it,2010,04, 16,1.0,3821,670,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20100416

Given that I bought it for backups, not for travel, I actually like it this way.It's probably helpful to enumerate the features I feel are worth being aware of before one buys it (and I shall answer any additional questions if you drop a comment, to the extent that I can):# Heavy, solid build, almost bullet-proof enclosure.# 8""x4""x1"" rectangular prism (these are not exact measurements but I'm confident it's close.# USB port for data transfer, cable included.# External power supply.# Silent run - you can't hear it spinning unless you place it close to your ear.# Cool - after one night of uninterrupted operation it was barely warmer than room temperature.# Not a speed demon but I backed up 50GB in something like 20-30 minutes.# Formated as FAT32.# Comes with no software but it was instantly recognized by both Vista and my PS3 (more about that later)# There is no manual to speak of - and no manual is needed.# One year warranty.# 30-day free tech support during the warranty period where the clock starts running after the first call to WD.# Lacks the (to me annoying) carnival lights that some other drives have these days - only one blue LED, on the back, blinks when read/writes are performed.# Competitive in price with theWestern Digital Elements 1 TB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive WDE1UBK10000N (Black)which I happen to own.I can't think of anything bad to say about the WD Elements. I went for the 1TB size because I wanted to back up several smaller computers on it and my 320GB PS3. For a stress test and if you are going to use it with XP or Vista you may want to reformat the disk as NTFS - Microsoft will be spinning your disk for many, many hours and, if you bought a dud, chances are it will stop working during the 10-12 hours format process. Or, you can check the 'fast format' option and the formatting will be done in less than one minute.After the overnight test was passed, I partitioned the disk into 4 using Vista (no problem whatsoever) and I formated 3 of them as NTFS and one as FAT32 (get FAT32FORMAT off the Net because Microsoft's utility does not work on a 300GB partition). Backups ran flawlessly with Microsoft's backup interface and backing up the PS3 was incident-free too - it instantly recognized the FAT32 partition and I have a nice PS3 backup now.I highly recommend this drive as a backup device that does not travel a lot. If you wish to save a few dollars and don't have much use for an extra 300GB, go with this one. Otherwise, get the 1TB version.","[31, 32]","Inspires confidence, priced right",2009,01, 21,0.96875,2765,499,Positive,31,32,1,0.023383813711121967,20090121

It is USB 2.0 certified, meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and, if your device accepts a Micro-B plug, this is the cable to get. Maybe the 2-meter length (6+ ft.) is a little bit too much but it does not bother me a lot and there may come a time when a cable this long may come in handy.I am awarding this item 5 stars for price, quality and for not making any special 'claims' as a pretext to charge an inflated price.But, YES, it DOES work with the latest Kindle and YES, you can use with with a Blackberry Bold and most smart phones and headsets.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need. If in doubt, do some more research or call the maker's tech support.","[14, 16]",Good generic but make sure it's the 'micro' B (not Mini B) that you need,2011,03, 23,0.875,1872,343,Positive,14,16,2,0.022797589969060415,20110323

The bundled free software includes Microsoft Works, Skype, some games and some annoying '60-day-trial' bloatware such Norton 360.Overall, this is a good machine if travel is not its main purpose and if the relatively low price is factored in. It will replace a basic desktop once a mouse is added.______________________________________________________Detailed reviewDelivery and physical setup---------------------------The 'laptop' comes securely packaged in a relatively small box. The package is easy to open and there isn't a lot of assembly required. Besides the laptop's body, there is the power supply, a couple of CDs and not much else.Specs------ Dual-core Intel T3400 processor at 2.16 GHz- 3GB SDRAM expandable to 4GB- 250GB hard drive- 17"" display- 802.11b/g Wi-fi- DVD drive- Webcam + microphone- 3 USB 2.0 ports- Modem- Ethernet port- RGB monitor port- 5-in-1 Bridge Media Adapter slot that supports Memory Stick, Memory Stick Pro, Secure Digital, MMC and xD media- Near full-size keyboard with numeric keypad- TouchpadOn the Vista performance benchmark, the Satellite scores a 3.3 with 'graphics' accounting for its lowest scores - 3.3 for Aero and 3.4 for 3D business and gaming and the CPU (5.1) and the hard drive (5.3) being the highest.Setup-----Vista Setup begins as soon as the power button is pressed and it completes quickly. Once an account is created and after given permission, the Satellite was able to quickly find and join my Wi-fi network and download and install the latest mostly Vista updates - over 40 of them.To my surprise, there wasn't a lot of bloatware, Norton 360 60-day trial being the most annoying of them all - its window pops up and it can't be closed, the only apparent option being to run the setup. I was able to get rid of it by immediately removing it and other unwanted 'free' or 'free trial' offers such as NetZero before touching their setup processes. The Google Toolbar installed itself before asking but a 'thank you' pops up when it's finished.Explorer and Windows Media Player are present but it was easy to install my favorite browser (Chrome) and relegate the Explorer to the second-tier, 'backup browsers' status.Once the Norton 360 is removed, Vista begins to complain about its lacking virus protection. One reasonable truly free offer, and this is what I installed, was Avira. Once Avira was installed, I was able to register it with Defender and Vista stopped complaining.Other pre-installed but not '60-day trial' packages included are Picassa and Google Desktop. They can be easily downloaded off the Net but I don't mind them being there since they do not interact intrusively with the user.Operation and Ergonomics------------------------As I mentioned already, the keyboard is a little unusual. While large, some of the keys are not where I would expect them - the Fn and Ctrl keys, for example are switched as compared with my familiar Thinkpad layout, the shapes of the 'Backspace' and 'Tab' are a little odd and so is the layout of the top row function keys. I would not type my next novel on this keyboard. Being a spoiled Thinkpad user, I missed the little knob that controls the mouse pointer movements. The touch pad works but it doesn't work for me. I wasn't comfortable until I attached a Logitech Nano cordless mouse by inserting its little dongle into one of the 3 available USB ports.In my opinion, the display is the best part in the Satellite. It's large and it's bright. Wide-screen DVD movies play great on it but, sadly, this being a Toshiba (not a Sony) the optical drive does not support Blu-ray.The integrated Webcam works well with apps such as Google Chat or Skype and it's well integrated and easy to use.The Satellite weight - really, really heavy - does not make it suited for frequent travel. Its lacking a docking station add-on does not make it a good telecommuting choice.______________________________________________________Rating and evaluationThe Satellite 355's size and weight do not make it a good choice for anyone looking for a traditional 'laptop'. However, anyone looking for a 'sometimes portable desktop' that integrates just about everything other than the mouse, this can be a good compromise. This is exactly what I wanted for one of my sons and I am therefore happy with my purchase.______________________________________________________CUSTOMER SUPPORT (6 months later)I am trying to find a not-so-harsh word to describe's Toshiba's attitude toward their customers but I must give up so I'd rather present the facts.When this laptop's screen broke (apparently my son broke it so warranty didn't apply) Toshiba demanded that I paid almost what it took to buy the laptop NEW six months or so ago - subtract 50 from the sale price and you'd get an idea. The alternative was to go directly to one of Toshiba's authorized repair centers but, after calling a couple, it was clear that they were going to bill me for even more than Toshiba demanded.I will now have to decide between taking a gamble and buying the display myself (it's not too expensive and about 1/4 of what Toshiba asked to fix my laptop) or learn to live with a broken display - attach a keyboard and a monitor to the laptop and use it as a desktop. By the way, Toshiba makes it VERY hard for 'regular people' to replace parts themselves. One must run a setup utility whenever parts are replaced and enter some codes to register the part. Both the setup utility and the codes are given to Toshiba's authorized centers only so that they can overcharge customers.I find this to be completely unacceptable and this is probably the last Toshiba product I will ever buy. Consumers should be viewed as 'valuable customers' not helpless cash cows with big wallets to be milked over and over again because they don't have alternatives.By contrast, other vendors are way better. Electronics don't break too often but here are my few experiences. I had a Philips monitor that broke in what turned out to be the last week of 'warranty'. Philips fixed it and, amazingly, all they asked from me was the monitor's serial number. I bought a Samsung DLP TV that had a VERY SMALL display defect. After several attempts at repair failed, Samsung replaced it with a new TV and they reset the warranty to the date the NEW TV was delivered. A Sony digital camera got drenched at Niagara Falls and the LCD display in the back stopped working. Sony fixed it for a VERY REASONABLE fee, even though it was no longer under warranty. These are companies I will continue to patronize. Toshiba is not one of them.And, one more thing. The usual wait time on hold is over 15 minutes, and this is AFTER the offshore call-taker picks up the phone and makes some time-wasting, unneeded and annoying scripted chit-chat (""is it okay if I call you by the first name?"" and ""[first name inserted here], what are you using your computer for?"").","[24, 24]",The Portable Desktop [please read note on customer support],2009,05, 17,1.0,7266,1214,Positive,24,24,0,0.02318840579710145,20090517

Up to 3 separate speaker boxes can be paired with on USB transmitter if one wishes to turn a PC into a mini home broadcast station. In addition, the iPod tray will charge the iPod while playing it. Finally, for those who wish to use these wireless speakers in a wired configuration, it will connect with and play any device compatible with 3.5 mm line out (mini stereo) or an RCA connector. The supplied iPod-centric remote control (battery included) also controls the speaker's volume, allows for switching between the 3 possible inputs and turns the speakers on or off.The trilingual, poster-style folded manual covers the warranty and the basic setup steps. In addition, an English-only 'tips' addition explains how possibly extend the theoretical 100 ft. range by using the included flexible USB adapter and makes the user aware that up to 3 devices can be simultaneously when the wireless input is selected.This what I liked about the Mint Studio Wireless PC/Mac Speaker with iPod/iPhone Dock:- Setup for wireless operation - the only one that interests me - was quick and easy. All that's needed is to activate the remote control by removing the foil keeping the battery disconnected and plug it in.- The USB transmitter installed itself in about 1 minute on my Vista laptop and began transmitting immediately.- The practical wireless range seems to approach the theoretical claim. I walked with my laptop all throughout our rather large house, including the basement and the speaker stayed connected and played all the time.- Good volume with very little distortion even at the max.- Careful packaging with all the shiny surfaces well protected.- Very funny back of the box.The following I did not like or didn't impress me so much:- The 1 year warranty statement expects that the buyer ships the item at his/her own risk and expense and there is enough lawyerese there to ensure that warranty repairs would be at the manufacturer's discretion.- The top and bottom of the normal audio range seem to be missing. Both the bass and the treble are lacking but it should be okay for listening to Internet radio or some other low-fi sources.- The manual control buttons are small and, in my view, ergonomically misplaced on the sides of the iPod tray (pray that the remote never stops working).- There is not feedback on the speaker side when operating the remote control - like maybe blinking when volume up or volume down are pressed on the remote.- The very shiny, very black finish looks good until you actually touch it because it will collect and display every single fingerprint.Overall, I like this speaker and I will be using with my laptop in my home office to listen to Internet radio.

I purchased this one because my first-time dealing with this company was a good experience. So, here I go again, getting my $299.99 TV covered for three years and not paying a lot for it.THE PURCHASE EXPERIENCEGetting the warranty was relatively easy. The first time around I had a few questions because our TV is a DLP, not an LCD, Plasma or LED but, to my surprise the off-shore persons answering the phone - and it was easy to get to talk to a human - were able to intelligently search their knowledge base, find the definition of DLP, determine that my TV could be covered, correctly answer my question regarding the DLP's replacement lamp (no, it's not covered) and made a note in their system that my TV was a DLP. I called again this time and, again, the off-shore person answered my questions intelligently.Shortly after I actually completed the purchase at Amazon, I received an email from SquareTrade that had a printable copy of the service agreement/contract.I was told over the phone that I had to get a userID/password at their site in order to be able to manage my coverage information. Once that completed, I was able to log in and retrieve my contract number and instructions on how to send SquareTrade my proof of purchase - simply paste Amazon's invoice into an email that has the contract number in the subject line.SquareTrade then sent me an email that acknowledged me sending them my proof of purchase and advising me to keep the original because they were not going to actually verify my purchase until I made my first claim.COVERAGEIt may be interesting to understand how coverage works without spending time on the phone with the company reps so, here it is.- There is a 60-day full refund upon cancellation provision so, if you don't like the service agreement, it's easy to cancel.- This coverage is concurrent with the manufacturer's warranty. In other words, this 3-year coverage begins on the day you sign for it but SquareTrade won't be taking claims from you while the manufacturer's warranty is still in effect. If your manufacturer has a one-year warranty on your TV, SquareTrade will cover it for years 2, 3. HOWEVER, and this is a good thing, the contract stipulates that IF the manufacturer refuses to honor their warranty for whatever reason (item purchased from an unauthorized dealer, for exeample) SquareTrade WILL cover you instead.- The value of coverage is limited to whatever you paid for your TV. This is important so, let me provide the full quote from the agreement:[The total amount that We will pay for repairs or replacement made in connection with all claims that You make pursuant to this Service Agreement shall not exceed the purchase price of the Product, less taxes. In the event that We make payments for repairs, which in the aggregate, are equal to the purchase price or replace the Product with a new, rebuilt or refurbished product of equal or similar features and functionality, We will have no further obligations under this Service Agreement.]- There is a 'no lemon' provision in the agreement which states that if the same item is repaired 3 times for the same defect within a year they will replace your TV with an equivalent product, at which time the warranty coverage ends - will not cover the replacement.- If your TV is damaged by a power surge and you had a power surge protector they may ask you to send it over to them for examination (probably to see if they can get some money from the power surge protector manufacturer).- Any time we are talking about replacements, they reserve the right to ask for the defective item to be sent to them and they will provide the box and the shipping label.- They will help arrange for in-house repairs and pay the repair company directly IF your TV is not shippable. On TVs under 37"" they will send you a shipping kit.- They do not cover scratches or cracks.- They do not cover any damage caused by you doing terrible things to your TV - like leaving it out in the rain.- There is no deductible.- They will allow for the agreement to be transferred if you sell your TV - can do it at their Web site.MY RATINGI haven't made any claim yet but, since Amazon stands behind this company and based on the service agreement and on my experience in dealing with the people at the call center, I am confident that this is a company worth doing business with so they get a 5-star.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[2, 2]",Happy enough to become a repeat customer,2010,11, 17,1.0,4640,816,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20101117

If what you need is a true HDMI 1.4x cable, then the one to get is that which is described as ""HDMI with Internet"" which adds the data channel and support for higher video resolutions.You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support the HDMI 1.4 standard such as TVs, receivers or Blu-ray players. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and will allow you TV to send audio data BACK to your receiver if so connected, therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated audio cable. This specific cable will probably NOT support HDMI 1.4 Ethernet feature. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4-ready hardware in the near future.Unless either of the above is true, you will not need this cable and, given that the HDMI 1.4 standards aren't set in stone yet - this cable complies with the recently released HDMI 1.4a specs for 3D - you should be better off waiting for the dust to settle. Keep in mind that BOTH connected devices need to support the HDMI 1.4 standard for this cable to make a difference and that it is NOT possible to upgrade any existing equipment (TV, Blu-ray player) to support HDMI 1.4.HOW GOOD IS IT?On my equipment, this worked as well as any older HDMI 1.3x cable. It replaced an existing 'cheap' wire at the back of my entertainment center and, nothing unexpected happened. The picture on my TV was as beautiful as before. The cable's short length (2 meters) and its 'high speed' certification make me confident that this cable will serve me well.Briefly, this cable:- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable. If all you need is HDMI 1.3x then go for it or go for any other cheap HDMI 1.3x wire.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p including in 3D.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) is missing but it that would only work with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment so I'm not sure if it would be missed for the next couple of years.- The advertised audio return channel is another HDMI 1.4 feature that most currently owned equipment can't take advantage of.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment NOT by the cable.WHY 3 STARSA 3-star rating should be fair (and I am not factoring in the price) because this cable, while working perfectly as an HDMI 1.3x, is an incomplete HDMI 1.4 implementation. Incomplete HDMI 1.4 implementations are allowed by the HDMI consortium but there I see no advantage in purchasing a feature-crippled cable when full-featured alternatives are available. 'Niche' HDMI cables make sense form a vendor's point of view because a buyer may be willing to pay more for such an item but their marketing can only confuse and annoy the buyers. It should cost a vendor about the same to manufacture a 'universal' HDMI 1.4 wire as it does to make an incomplete (niche) product. In fact there may be economies of scale in producing 'universal' HDMI 1.4 cables only so marketing seems to be the only reason we get to see these intentionally crippled products.My recommendation would be NOT to buy this cable. Get the 'High-Speed with Ethernet' if you want/need HDMI 1.4 or get an HDMI 1.3x otherwise.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET (NOT supported by this specific product) means that a cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel (supported) would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices, usually a TV that might get content directly from a USB storage device or the Ethernet and an HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver.- HDMI 1.4a brought HDMI in line with the recently agreed upon 3D TV industry standards but, consistent with HDMI's consortium's encouraging vendors to avoid talking about the actual version their HDMI cables are implementing, we simply don't know whether this one is HDMI 1.4 or HDMI 1.4a. Since '3D' is mentioned it's probably safe to assume HDMI 1.4a.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p. Be aware that there are now THREE different HDMI connectors: standard, mini and micro.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf all of the above, only the a 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' makes sense.Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[412, 452]","HDMI 1.4 cable lacking data channel support but still OK as an HDMI 1.3x, gets full Amazon support",2009,10, 1,0.911504424778761,6919,1161,Neutral,412,452,40,0.034522064810291485,20091001

However, I suggest that you look around before you place the order because you just might have one of these already as they tend to ship with many electronic gadgets these days.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need.Whenever in doubt, do some more research and keep in mind that the 'Micro-B' (very small) is the emerging standard and it's likely to be found on the newer and smaller gadgets - phones, cameras, etc. but, before it we had the 'Mini-B' (this specific cable) so the older devices will need the 'Mini'.","[214, 218]","Reasonably priced, gets full Amazon support behind it but makes sure this is what you need",2009,11, 12,0.981651376146789,3473,618,Positive,214,218,4,0.0292460511317375,20091112

It is an extension cable with 'Type A' connectors at BOTH ends (male and female) - meaning that this cable will NOT connect 2 devices by itself. It will only work with and extend a 'regular' USB cable that has a 'Type A' male connector at one end. 'Type A' is the type of connector that would normally plug into your computer or laptop USB port.These being said, I found it quite useful with peripherals that come with permanently attached cables that are not as long as I wish they were. I am using mine with a Logitech Driving Force GT Racing Wheel and with a T-flight Hostas joystick on which we can use a longer cable.There's not much to say other than everything is done right, including the price. It is USB 2.0 certified and connectors at both ends appear to be gold-plated and solidly built.

Altec's product manages to come a long way toward fully meeting expectations but, and understandably in my view, it sometimes  comes short of 'perfection'.This model includes a Bluetooth transceiver that delivers A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) capabilities when connected to any player that has a standard 3.5 mm audio output jack. The transceiver encodes the incoming audio and streams high-quality stereo output wirelessly to the Bluetooth headphones.You get the following in the box:- Stereo headphones- with one pair of silicone ear buds (still trying to find a source for replacements)- Bluetooth 'Bluetooth adapter' with 3.5 mm jack to use with music devices that output stereo sound, usually iPods or MP3 players- Charger capable to charge both the headphones and the Bluetooth adapter simultaneously through USB Micro connections- English/Spanish manual, pretty good, actuallyMy review will first discuss features that I deem important then, I will close with a brief evaluation.Headphones:=========While not 'high end', they deliver a reasonably good quality sound. Some may have issues with headphones that go 'in' the ear rather than covering the ear. I know that I do but I seem to tolerate these quite well for as long as the volume is kept low.On the positive side, the 2 headphones are connected with a stereo cable that goes on the back of the head. This makes the entire assembly nearly invisible when worn at least when the person who wears them has hair :). The microphone seems to be integrated in the headphones body and it seems to work well because no one asked me to speak louder while on the phone, using the BackBeat.The main concern is 'anatomy'. I have a big head and big ears and setting the earphones was not easy in the beginning even though the telescoping and swiveling adjustments do allow for some flexibility in wearing. I find that, the more I get used to them, the easier it is to wear them. Again, a positive, once set, the extremely light weight makes for a very comfortable wear, so comfortable they almost 'disappear', unless they fall off.Pairing and maintaining connections:===========================This is where Altec needs to do some work to improve ease of use.- I had no problem pairing the Bluetooth adapter and a Blackberry. It all works as the manual advises. When pairing the the phone, the headphones' password is always '0000' but I can't see a significant security risk.- The first device to be paired MUST be the 'Bluetooth adapter'. There is note at the Vine site that offers some advice on what to do when in trouble. I am going to post it as a commentary to this review because it's very helpful and I don't believe it's available on the Amazon official page.- The steps to reconnect may vary from phone to phone but, so far so good. I walked several times out of range and, except for the first time, all I had to do was to turn the Bluetooth adapter off and then back on. I found that I had to tap the left ear button when initiating the first phone call after walking out of range. It's possible that different phone may behave differently. My phone is a Blackberry Bold.Controls:======It may take some getting used to but, here are the simple conventions:- Phone controls are mostly on the left-ear headphone- Music device controls are mostly on the right-year headphone- Rising tones usually mean that the feature is enabled/set/increased while falling tones mean the oppositeOn the phone side, you can answer the call, hang up, reject the call while listening to music, mute, raise/lower the volume, check the battery charge.For music features you can pause play, advance or go back one track (not tested by me yet), increase/decrease volume, enable/disable bass boost, pick up the phone or reject a call while listening. Play resumes after a call ends.It took very little time for the controls to become second nature.Performance and other characteristics:=============================Both devices - headphones and Bluetooth adapter - can be charged by the same one charger, simultaneously. A full charge completes in about 3 hours and little blue lights indicate the charge is full. Partial charging is possible in less than one hour. Battery life on both devices is about 7 hours and my usage so far tends to confirm this.A carrying pouch is missing and it's missed. With 3 very small devices (counting the charger) I would have felt much better if one was included. I understand that the design was meant to allow carrying the headphones and the Bluetooth adapter in a shirt pocket but I would have felt much more comfortable if I could store them somewhere other than a small pocket.__________________________________I hesitate between 4 and 5 stars. The more I use the BackBeat the more I enjoy using it. However, the missing carrying case - not easy to explain on a device within this price range - the few minor glitches encountered when pairing and the constant inability to auto-reconnect after walking out of range and the lack of information on where or how to obtain spare ear buds call for a 4-star rating. With only a few small improvements, Altec could have a big winner in this product.","[3, 4]",Double-duty Bluetooth (phone+player) stereo headphones,2009,04, 22,0.75,5569,930,Positive,3,4,1,0.02247191011235955,20090422

This is an external optical drive that reads Blu-ray discs and can read and write DVD discs. It will NOT play Blu-ray movies unless you have a Blu-ray player software installed on your computer.These being said, what my computer believes it's a ""MATSHITA BD-CMB UJ141AL 1001 10091400"" turned out to be quite a decent external drive. The plastic enclosure is reasonably sturdy but the disc tray needs to be treated gently when opened - it's probably easy to break but it's no worse than the disc trays that are part of any brand-name laptop internal DVD drive.The drive is powered through one or 2 USB 2.0 ports and the 2 cables are included. I was able to operate the drive while powered through one USB port only.I am not using the drive to play Blu-ray movies but, given that it was able to read Blu-ray discs reliably, I assume that it should play movies with the proper software.On a Windows 7 machine the drive was recognized and could be used immediately and I suspect that all Windows XP or later machines should have no problems. There drive comes with a CD to install the drive on Windows 98 computers.As for the manual, I don't understand why they didn't use Google's free auto-translate service. The output would have been a lot better than ""damager caused by unauthorized repairs are not included within the guarantee period and they are subject to be charged"" or ""please do not place the driver under easy pressure to guarantee the proper operation of the drive."" By the way, the reference to 'guarantee' above does not mean that a warranty is actually provided because I couldn't find any warranty statement.To conclude: good external drive, doesn't play Blu-ray movies unless you have the software, no documentation, no explicit warranty, no tech support. Me, I'm happy with what I got and reading the 12 (short) paragraphs 'manual' was fun so it's 3 stars meaning ""it's Okay"".My advice: if the tray doesn't open, the case is cracked or the drive is not quickly recognized by your XP or later Windows computer, return it immediately. If it actually works - and mine did - chances are it will continue to work for a long time if treated with care.","[30, 34]",NOT a Blu-ray player but an Okay external Blu-ray drive,2011,05, 19,0.8823529411764706,2227,390,Neutral,30,34,4,0.023253541768441622,20110519

The ear-tips fit inside the ear canal and muffle all but the loudest outside noise therefore making them an excellent 'at home' listening option but probably not recommended while driving or even walking. The 4 ft. long chord is perfect for listening off an iPod but may not be long enough if one wants to plug then into a computer.THE LONG DISCUSSION:====================Personal bias and circumstances-------------------------------For the sake of honest disclosure, I do not consider myself an audiophile. I do listen to music and I do use earphones while in the office but most of my listening comes from open speakers. Since most of my listening is done either in the car or in the office where I must be aware of my surroundings, I will not use these earphones. This is GREAT news for my just-turned-teen kid who's jumping up and down with joy because he tried them out and he absolutely LOVES them.Contents--------You get the following in the box:- Earphones- 3 pairs of different size ear tip gels (small, medium, large)- Ear tip cleaning tool- Tin case- Multi-language manual/warranty statement pageEvaluation----------- The following are my views on manufacturer's claims and they seem to hold true:[TRUE] - Enhanced bass, dynamic in-ear headphones. - The sound quality, bass included is clearly superior to whatever ear buds came with my kids MP3 player.[TRUE] - Noise-isolating. - These are not noise-cancelling earphones. By simply stuffing the ear tip gels into your ears you no longer hear most of the sounds produced by the outside world.[TRUE] - Comfortable. - I have a low tolerance to in-ear headphones but, to my surprise, I enjoyed wearing these for extended periods.[TRUE] - Compact design. - They are, indeed small.[MOSTLY TRUE] - Feel your music, not your earphones. - As I stated already, they are comfortable. I can't say that I can't feel them but I have no problem tolerating them.- The 2 year warranty provides for replacement or repair of the earphones IF you are the original purchaser, can prove it and you didn't abuse them in some unspecified way. However, the warranty does NOT cover the wires or the connector so, if the wire breaks, you're out of luck.Rating------With the exception of the rather strange warranty limitation, I find these to be VERY good at their price point. While they don't approach the level of a $200 or $1000 earphones set, the sound quality is actually good and most of the outside noise is successfully muffled or eliminated. The carrying tin case is a big plus because it allows for keeping everything in one place and I don't understand why many similar products in the $100 price range don't provide this convenience. The wires are a little fragile and, unless treated with care they COULD break.My overall rating is 4.5 stars but I am going to round it up to 5.","[6, 7]",Excellent at this prince point.

With patience and a pair of scissors, the mouse does come out, eventually, in less than 5 minutes. Nobody gets hurt. Must pay attention to the 'Nano' dongle. It's very small and it could get lost easily.- Once out of the box, insert the 2 AAA batteries - provided - plug in the Nano dongle into a USB port and, 30 second later, the mouse is ready to use. Can click, move the pointer around the screen and scroll.- I notice a little folded-paper manual, written in 4 languages which suggests to do what I just did. The the one useful part says that the mouse goes to sleep by itself if I don't use it for a while but, if I want to really turn it off, I must insert the Nano dongle into the slot at the bottom of the mouse and then it turns itself off.- Since the pointer seems a little bit too jumpy, I decide to run the 'software'. This time, I am presented with an option of 6 languages. I select 'English' and I am asked to ""select what type of device you uses"". The correct answer seems to be '3-button mouse' (5-button mouse is the default selection) and everything installs in about 20 seconds. Then, I am told that the 'mouse setting software' will launch. It doesn't. I find it by clicking on 'all programs' and it sets 2 things: whether the scroll wheel advances by 1, 2, 3 lines or one screen at a time and what it should do when I click on it. That's it. There are no option to calibrate the pointer's behavior.- I uninstall the mouse setting software.EVALUATIONI am going to preface the good parts with a + and the bad ones with a -, starting with the good parts.+ Easy to setup on Vista. Once the Nano is into USB port, it's ready to go within seconds. No need of software, really.+ Dongle is small and it can be plugged either on a side USB or a back USB port. I have it with another thumb drive plugged in the USB port above it and they don't bother each other at all.+ Dongle storage 'in the mouse' is excellent. The Nano is so small, it absolutely NEEDED some good way to store it and, what better way than by plugging it IN the mouse when not in use?+ Batteries included - I know, 2 AAA's aren't worth that much but it helps when you get the mouse, are eager to use it and find yourself lacking them.- Too small. This is not a universal negative so I should rather write 'too small for my hands'. It's not big deal because I really bought it for my 12 yr. old boy and his hands are smaller than mine.- Software is lacking needed features, such as the ability to calibrate the pointer.- By default, the pointer moves too much and there's no way to change it - see above. I suspect, my kid will get used to it, eventually.- The scroll wheel feels cheap and not as comfortable and responsive as an nearly identical model sold by a competitor - whose product comes with MUCH BETTER software, by the way.- It goes to sleep too quickly and the software doesn't support changing that and it doesn't wake up just by moving the mouse, you actually have to click a button.- Packaging is pretty but removing it can be frustrating.RATINGSince there is a nearly identical product to compare with - I suppose they both come out of the same off-shore factory - this mouse comes out short in more than one way. However, it's usable and it's a little less expensive than the competitor's. For what I paid (lightning deal) I will keep it. My kid is a heavy user so, if it breaks before 6 months, I will come back to this review and update it.The Verbatim's Nano earns 3 stars. This is a mild positive in my view. It's not exceptional, it's not 'good' but it's usable.NOTE ON BATTERY LIFE (Oct 5, 2009)We had to replace the 2 original AAA batteries after about 6 weeks of use. This compares unfavorably with some other 'Nano' models from another vendor which claim about one year of expected battery life. We have one of those and, indeed, we are still running with the same set of batteries for the past 6+ months.","[1, 1]",A few issues but usable,2009,08, 28,1.0,4050,766,Neutral,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20090828

Mitsubishi's WD-73737 was the easy winner and this is why:- SIZE - well, 73"" is bigger than 61"", right? As far as I know, there aren't too many LCD or plasma TVs this  big, at least not anything that I can afford. Our living room is rather large - it's really most of our first floor (open style architecture) so it helps to have a big screen. Mitsubishi makes an 82"" model but I had also to consider...- PRICE - we have a clear winner here. When it comes to price/size ratio, DLP's are by far the least expensive option.- ENERGY EFFICIENCY - according to my research, the WD-73737 burns about 265W when 'on' (this includes the 180W lamp). By comparison, a 70"" LCD needs 540-630W to operate.- 3D CAPABILITY - it's a potential plus. Mitsubishi does not guarantee that its TV will be compliant with whatever 3D standard is about to emerge but... it might.Of course, not everything is perfect so, here are the potential 'minuses':- LAMP - when it comes to 'cost of ownership', we must factor in the DLP's lamp. The Mitsubishi manual expects its lamp to last for about one year but our Samsung was still okay after 2 years with the original lamp so, we shall see. A replacement for this model, direct from Mitsubishi is $99 and I will get a free one under warranty if the original needs replacement before one year. Given the great energy savings when compared to an LCD TV, I am not too worried about having to replace the lamp from time to time.- BULK - this set is over 90 lbs. heavy and over 12"" at its thickest. Definitely, can't hang it on a wall. Therefore...- STAND - you must have one. We are using the one that came with the old 61"" and all is fine but if you don't have one it should set you back a few more hundred bucks.- THE SCREEN - nothing wrong with it but, when compared with our old Samsung, this is just a little more reflective. It's not so to the point of being annoying at night if lights are on in the room but sometimes it is noticeable.Since we already had a stand, didn't want to hang a 73"" TV on the wall and the need to replace the lamp was compensated by its energy savings, we went for the WD-73737 without hesitation and we are happy we did.OUR SETUPA TV this size would normally be used in a home theater setting and, it turns out, that's how we use it. We have a satellite TV box, a PS3, dedicated Blu-ray player a 7.1 surround receiver and a Harmony 900 remote. The TV comes with LOTS of inputs, including 3 HDMI but, in our case, the setup started with plugging the TV into the power outlet, connecting the HDMI cable into one of TV's HDMI ports and, since I had the Harmony 900 already configured to handle the TV, that was IT, we were watching TV within 5 minutes of it coming out of the box.Later own, we did some fine tuning but, it turns out, very little had to be adjusted. We made sure that the frame rate was set to 120 fps and, for the rest, we took the recommended settings from the Tweak TV site and didn't have to change too much from what they recommended. We ended up with:Picture Mode: NaturalColor Temperature: LowAspect Ratio: StandardContrast: 55Brightness: 36Color: 31Tint: 31Sharpness: 31Deep Field Imager: OffSuper Resolution: OffSharp Edge: OffVideo Noise: OffThe end-result is as close to picture-prefect as they come.I have nothing to say about the sound - it can simulate 'surround' with its own speakers - because we are not using it. Same when it comes to channel tuning or setting up 'activities'. These are fully handled by the satellite receiver and the Harmony remote but all the capabilities are there. Same when it comes to the remote which is quite small - a nice thing - but it may take some getting used to when it comes to the buttons size (small) and their layout.WARRANTYOn an object this size, this is an important concern so, here's what matters:- The screen is only covered for 30 (THIRTY) days.- The picture quality warranty states that Mitsubishi will fix it if you get less than 99.99% of the pixels right. In other words, you should have at least 9,999 out of 10,000 pixels right. On a 2-million pixel screen this means that if you have up to 199 bad pixels, Mitsubishi is not obligated to fix your TV.- Everything else is covered for one year.- The lamp will be replaced free of charge if it needs replacement within the first year.- Service is provided 'in house' IF you are within the coverage of an authorized Mitsubishi center. If you're not, you will be responsible for taking your TV there so you better check you are inside a Mitsubishi service area.__________________________________[Note on warranty - Nov. 12, 2010]I had to call Mitsubishi because the lamp had to be replaced. Within minutes, I was on the phone with a competent person who, after asking that I reset the TV and me confirming that the picture was still dim agreed to send me a replacement lamp under the warranty. I provided the TV's serial number and date of purchase, my address and my phone number. He promised that the replacement lamp will be shipped within 2-5 business days.A few days later, the lamp arrived. I called Mitsubishi's warranty dept. about me returning the used lamp but they asked me not to bother. I trust and respect a company that trusts and respects its customers.__________________________________MY RATINGThis TV delivers exactly what I wanted and expected: a large, bright, crisp picture that, thanks to the 120 fps display has very little blur on fast moving objects. The drawbacks: need to replace the lamp, unorthodox layout on the remote, bulk are either counterbalanced by other features or did not matter much in my case. Not everyone could live with a TV that's not totally flat or that needs a stand but if the main concerns are picture quality, price, size and energy consumption, this TV is hard to beat.I will grant the WD-73737 5 stars because I own it and I am very happy with it.","[51, 51]",Can't get much better than this,2010,03, 21,1.0,6122,1113,Positive,51,51,0,0.02406774141019378,20100321

The part that plugs into your computer's USB port slides in and out of the protective casing and you ergonomically control it with your thumb. This makes this drive 'smaller' which may or may not be a good thing if you misplace it :) This and its good I/O speed make me love this Cruiser but anyone uncomfortable with removing preinstalled software from the drive and or formatting it should look elsewhere (see the 'warning' paragraph).I bought this refurbished because it was dirt cheap - less than 50 cents per GB at the time of purchase - but, it turns out, affordability is not the only feature  worth discussing. I will list what I believe to be the positives/negatives below.+ Low price: spectacularly low at the time of purchase, likely to go lower because flash drive prices seem to be in a free fall.+ Large capacity: 64 GB is way up there. It can easily hold EIGHT-to-TEN movies ripped to the highest DVD settings, menus, subtitles, audio tracks and extra features included.+ I/O not bad: benchmarked by me at 128 Mbit/s (16MB/s) reading large media files when formatted as FAT32 with 64KB clusters.+ Small physical size.+ The retractable capability protects the connector without the need of a removable and easy to lose cap.- Moving parts: the 'retractable' feature is nice but one thing that I used to like about thumb drives was 'no moving parts' which gave me more peace of mind when trusting them with important data. Occasionally my first attempt to push it into the USB port fails and I need to 'click it' into the extended position and try again.- Annoyingly bright pulsating light: there's no way to turn it off.- Obsolete SanDisk's U3 Launchpad app pre-installed and not easy to remove save for re-formatting.I will award this drive 5 stars mostly for the price (very low), good I/O speed and for its storage capacity. It's not the 'perfect' USB drive - see the 'minuses' listed above but the good features are good enough to make me 'love it' which is Amazon's standard for 5 stars._____________________________________NOTES:My drive came with SanDisk's U3 Launchpad installed. This is an 'old' technology meant to facilitate the launching of Windows apps of a flash drive and it may or may not be installed on the drives currently sold. It allowed U3-compliant apps to temporarily write to your computer's registry... probably not a well-thought method. SanDisk considers U3 'dead' at this time but you are likely to find the 'Launchpad' on the USB drive. The best way to completely remove it is via a SanDisk-supplied tool - I will post a comment with the URL. Once that is done, Windows 7 allowed me to format the drive as either FAT32, NTFS or exFAT.Using a USB drive with 'moving parts' to store/back up important data may not be a good idea. In my view, the drive is reasonably 'safe' but I'm only using it to transfer large media files from one computer to a media hub because transfer over USB is faster than transfer over Wi-Fi. I am not currently planning to store anything on it that's not backed up elsewhere, long term._____________________________________","[0, 0]","Inexpensive, physically small",2012,08, 21,,3169,543,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20120821

Of course, a lot of what this box has to offer depends on the software that DirecTV uploads into it.As other reviewers cautioned, please be aware that this is NOT a DVR. If you want a DVR, DirecTV has a plan that would get you one but, then, you would not be using this receiver.Major feature:- supports standard definition and HD resolutions up to 1080i- supports surround sound- major outputs via HDMI/DVI, component- does not support aerials- remote control is using infrared and can be set to control the TV as well- nice 'search' feature, allowing searches for show names or channel namesMajor problems:- does not allow to schedule for recurring shows (weekly, daily)- favorite channels lists are somewhat hard to set as it's difficult to sort out between pay-per-view, premium, local, HD and so on- blackouts or brownouts tend to reset the box and you may need to redo the setup all over again- I had one incident where the box stopped outputting HD. Luckily I had purchase the 'maintenance' plan from DirecTV so I did not have to pay for the technician's visit.- HD broadcasts, especially on the non-movie channels seem to be a little too over-compressed but that may not be DirecTV's fault entirely.- The remote control includes the DVR-only buttons which makes it a little confusing because they don't do anything when used with this receiver.Major positives:- I came to DirecTV after many years of DISH and I do not regret it. The HD plans appear to be superior to what the DISH has to offer or at least they were so six months or so ago when I switched.- Unlike to what other reviews claim, the DirecTV customer service is not TOO bad and they've been able to properly handle all issues so far, including sending over a repairman when I needed one.","[1, 1]","Adequate HD receiver, it is NOT a DVR",2009,02, 3,1.0,1900,335,Neutral,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20090203

Its media collector can be set to periodically check the connected computers and copy newly found media files to the server. The built in media servers would allow devices not specifically connected to the MediaSmart such as a PS3 or Xbox 360 to access and play the server's Music, Photo and Movie stores. The iTunes server will stream music and playlists to computers that are running iTunes or to compatible devices. In addition, there is an interface to allow for publishing one's photos to sites such as Google's Picassa or one's flickr page or Facebook account. The Windows Media Center connector allows clients with Windows Media Center installed to play music, videos and recorded TV stored on the home server. When properly setup, backups are possible externally on Amazon's S3 cloud (a paid service) and, with proper setup, the server could be managed and server's media files could be set to be accessible from the Net.After the initial setup, the backup and media streaming services can be made available to Mac clients.The MediaSmart's initial one-disk, 640GB storage capacity can be expanded by attaching up to 4 additional disk drives via USB ports. Once more than one disk is available, the media folders can be 'duplicated' to allow for data redundancy in the event of an accident.BRIEF EVALUATION:In my view, this specific model, while attempting to strike a balance between features and ease of operation/simplicity, it comes short of expectations, to various degrees, on both ends - the end product may not appear to be easy to setup to 'the average user' and it's not always easy to use while most of the services offered don't have sufficient flexibility in fine-tuning via the simple interfaces provided.But, here are the goods and the bads:(good)+ Backups, once the setup is complete do work+ Easy maintenance+ Server appears to recover nicely from minor incidents and outages+ Disk expansion via USB ports is as easy as plugging the disk in+ Once one or more disks are added, folder duplication does protect the data+ No bloatware. The only 'free trial' third party is the McAffee Total Protection service but it's an optional install and it does not pop up every time the home server is accessed+ Automatic Windows update for the Home Server operating system is easy to set up+ Expandable functionality through Additional add-ons installations+ Both the Windows Home Server online Help facility/manual and the MediaSmart manual are very well written(bad)- somewhat underpowered with an Atom one-core CPU and 1GB RAM.- 640GB is insufficient storage for a machine that's supposed to back up 'everything'- the out-of-the-box one-disk architecture puts data at risk- the only officially documented server expansion is additional disks but memory expansion, while not documented, should be possible- some difficulties can be encountered during the initial installation and setup- installation and setup does not allow for a lot of flexibility- a little awkward access to media files from registered clients - require a separate account setup even when 'read only' data is accessed- direct access to the Microsoft Home Server OS is labeled as risky - warning states that the OS COULD break if the native interface is usedTo be fair, once the initial setup completes, the server will operate more or less trouble-free for as long as the home network does not change in any dramatic fashion. The lack of flexibility can be addressed to some extent if one is willing to access and 'play' with each of the client machines configurations and access and tweak the Windows Home Server operating system directly but then the 'ease of setup' claim would have to be abandoned.MY EXPERIENCE:My own server installation, setup, operation and use can be summarized as follows:- Initial setup required significant changes at the server's own TCP/IP configuration and each of the client PC's. All was well documented in the 250-page manual but I did have to set up a static IP for the server, modify the HOSTS file on each PC, register several installed apps with the Windows Firewall.- Centralized backups were easy to configure but the options are few. The software decides by itself which folders should be excluded and there is no way to take them off the list. The only option is to add some more folders. The schedule can be configured for the server to retain the desired number of monthly, weekly and daily backups. The daily backups are incremental and they complete within minutes. The initial backup, depending on what network you are, can take many hours. It took hours for my computers in a 56Mps (about 6MB per second) wireless setting. Interestingly, the backup utility has the ability to 'wake up' a computer that's put to 'sleep' or 'hibernate' and, more often than not, it was able to put the machine back to sleep once the backup was finished.- The lack of flexibility makes the media collector, even when it works, not worth using. As far as data collection it has only 2 options: either a specific and preset collection of folders for the various type of media where  the files are more likely to be found - like 'My Music' for music - or 'all folders'. After testing the collection on 3 machines I found that on one it found a lot of 'stuff' that I didn't want found - little picture files associated with some software installations - while on another it found nothing even when I selected 'all folders'. I suspect something having to do with my setup but I decided to give up and I manually copied the media that I wanted on the server.- Surprisingly, one device that benefits the most seems to be our PS3 which picked up and was able to take advantage of the Media Server even before I was finished with the server setup. Even more surprisingly, no authentication was requested from the PS3 even though it was playing the same files that required an account and a password if I wanted to access them from my own computer.- Central stores for media files is a useful feature, especially when the folder duplication is activated.- The ability to publish photos to sites such as Picasa, flickr or Facebook works but, in the case of Picasa, which I tested, the task can be accomplished better with Picasa's own interface which provides a lot more flexibility.- Storage expansion is easy but, again, not sufficient flexibility. The first disk I plugged in had a FAT32 partition and a larger NTFS partition. My expectation was for the server to ignore the FAT32 and use the NTFS but, to my surprise, not only it reformatted the disk but it actually re-partitioned it and produced an NTFS-only, one-partition drive. Just to make it clear, it did tell me that it was going to reformat and repartition my disk before it proceeded to do so.- Self diagnostic and recovery seem to be satisfactory for minor glitches but, not sufficient information is available for more difficult troubleshooting unless one goes to the operating system. Unplugging the server did not damage it. Unplugging the attached disk created a number of errors and suggestions on how to fix them but, once the disk was plugged back in, the server became healthy again within minutes and, to my surprise, all the notifications simply disappeared as if there was never a problem.- With a Wireless-G router, providing 56Mbs, music streaming went well on the PS3. The PS3 immediately recognized the media server and it played the music.- Photo viewing was so-so on the internal network. Could see individual pictures but playing slide-shows with 3-5MB individual picture files was a little slow and choppy.- Video streaming was not acceptable at all but I suspect it would have been okay if I had a 'wired' home network.- I decided not to try remote access at this time because I had no compelling reasons to do so.RATING:- 3.5 Stars for INSTALLATION AND SETUP. The server does not normally install itself but a lot of the complication is attributable to the complexities of a home's network environment. I expect for real users to report anything from ""it installed within minutes and I didn't have to do a thing"" to ""I spent many hours with the HP Help Support and now I'm returning it because they couldn't help me."" It would have be nice if the printed version of the 200+ page manual was included in the box.- 2.0 Stars for DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE. I understand cost constraints issues but to sell a home SERVER with only one disk and a rather small one at that was not a wise decision. This is supposed to be sold to the 'average' home users and this makes it worse because it's the average users who do not understand that their data is NOT fully protected this way.- 3.0 Stars for PERFORMANCE. One Atom processor, one small disk (for a server) and only 1GB of memory do not assure me that the server will continue to perform adequately if and when more add-ons are installed. It gets 3 stars because it performs well at this time.- 4.0 Stars for EASE OF USE, once configured. The server administration is easy for as long as one doesn't forget the server's password. Most quirks are minor and, once configured, the server pretty much runs itself.- 3.0 Stars for CONFIGURABILITY. This has to do with the frustrating scarcity of options on services such as backups or media collection. I agree that most of the bases are covered on day one but a user's demands and sophistication tends to grow with use.- 4.0 Stars for FUNCTIONALITY. Backups and folder duplication are good for as long as a second disk is added. Media streaming works as well as the network bandwidth would allow it. Some of the services such as photo publishing or photo viewing are not likely to be used much. The same for over-the-Internet access which implies a level of user skills and sophistication at which one would probably not purchase this entry-level box. Same is true for the Amazon S3 backup service.- 3.0 Stars for EXPANDABILITY. USB disks are easy to add and users with some level of sophistication should be able to install add-ons without much difficulty - the process is well documented in the manual. However, there are no internal drive bays and I suspect that memory expansion or CPU upgrades are a pain, if possible at all without voiding the warranty.OVERALL RATING - 3 STARSWhile I can live with this server and I WILL be using it for worry-free backups and some media streaming and central storage, I would hesitate recommending it to a first-time user while knowing that superior products are currently available for not significantly more.__________________________________________Update:While I'm not compelled to change the 'star rating', I must note of another feature that I don't believe is documented but it's a really nice one: the Home Server seems to be monitoring and issuing certain security alerts concerning connected clients. It told me, for example, that there was an issue with my son's laptop spyware protection and, because of that, it marked the 'network state' as 'critical'. It turns out, that was indeed the case. His 'pay' virus/software protection had expired and it was a good opportunity to remove it and replace it with a free alternative.","[148, 162]",Features vs. Ease of Use vs. Cost - hard to find the perfect balance,2009,06, 30,0.9135802469135802,11396,1931,Neutral,148,162,14,0.026770884220810944,20090630

Based on my experience with WD (I own several), the Scorpios are reliable drives. The 2.5"" SATAs easily and perfectly mount inside a PS3's or laptop's drive bay where they can replace the laptop's or the PS3's original 20-40-60-80-160GB drive and the new PS3 120GM SLIM's without voiding the warranty.I have this exact model running inside my laptop as I am writing this review. The upgrade was relatively easy and it's been working well for the past several months. I can't think of any flaws and the price is right so the 500GB Scorpio Blue earns its 5 stars.______________________________________Laptop Upgrade:My 2 year old Thinkpad T60 came with a wimpy 60GB SATA drive. I needed  the ability to upgrade to the much larger 500GB and do it without having to reinstall the OS, apply the service packs and then reinstall and configure 100 different little apps.Acronis True Image Home 2009 PC Backup & Recoveryallowed me to do all of the above in about one hour. Its Utilities section has a 'clone' option that would copy EVERYTHING, including the Master Boot Record/Sector (MBR) from the puny 60GB drive unto the 500GB while allowing me to control the size of the active partition - this while the 500GB was connected through a USB wire and the laptop booted off the program's CD.Once the operation completed (50 minutes) I simply removed the old 60GB drive off my laptop and replaced it with the 500GB drive. Once the laptop was turned back on it booted up happily, with a 200GB master partition and a 300GB second partition. There are 3 words that I have to use to describe the process: PERFECTION and COMPLETE SATISFACTION. This capability alone is worth the price of this product.To my surprise, with the new drive, the Primary Hard Disk score as computed by Microsoft (right click on 'My computer' then select 'Properties') jumped from a decent 4.8 to an unexpected 5.7.______________________________________PS3 Upgrade:I have replaced my original PS3 drive with a 320 GB WD quite a while ago but, over the last weekend, I helped a friend of mine upgrade his PS3's with this one. He decided to pick this model and, since I had a great experience with the 320GB version, I encouraged him to go WD.My friend believes that the 500GB is at the peak of price/performance curve at this time. Like me, he has no plans of storing a movie library on the PS3 so he expects for the 500GB to be sufficient for the life of his console. After that, it's likely that he'll be buying the next generation game/multimedia machine. The 320 GB model that I used some time ago is still available but the 500 GB is only $30 more so it makes a lot of sense to spend a little more and enjoy the extra storage.Advice to the PS3 upgraders from someone who, after some hesitation, actually did it and then did it again a few more times for friends and family since:- If you need to format this drive or any drive to FAT32 - and you need a FAT32 partition for the PS3 backup - the best utility I found [...] - Google it and you shall find it out there. I'm not reviewing the formatter utility but I can tell you that it does a drive in less than 10 seconds AND it works on Vista too.- It helps to have a USB-connected drive handy to back up your PS3 content before upgrading. With one of these as the backup device, the PS3 fully restores EVERYTHING, including whatever copywrited or protected objects, such as, in my case the PS2 memory cards emulations and all the game saves.I will not go into upgrade details because there are lots of guides on the Net including great Youtube videos on how to do it but, if anyone has any questions, do leave a note and I shall reply as soon as I get to read it.To conclude, the upgrade proceeded without any glitches and my friend has now a perfectly working console where storage won't be an issue for some time to come. PS3 performance appears to the same, which is how it should be. I haven't heard back from my friend in 8 days now so, my assumption is that all is working well and he's busy enjoying his upgraded PS3.","[17, 18]",The Perfect Solution for a Laptop or PS3 HDD Upgrade,2009,08, 22,0.9444444444444444,4150,746,Positive,17,18,1,0.02292786191174076,20090822

Once the setup is complete, it simply... disappears and there's no need to worry about it or even be aware of its presence.PACKAGING AND CONTENTSIt comes in a small box, everything tightly and securely held inside.The 2 components are the remote adapter itself and the AC power adapter. The manual is a poster-style, step-by-step with pictures and text in 4 languages (English/French/Spanish/Portuguese).SETUPOnce the adapter is plugged, the PS3 side of the setup is as easy as going to Settings/Accessory Settings/Register BD Remote Control. The PS3 only accepts one remote control at a time and, since I already had the Sony remote control registered, it unregistered it and, once I pressed the 'connect' button on the bottom of the Logitech adapter, the PS3 recognized it.On the Harmony side - I have a Harmony 900 - I had to add the PS3 there. I picked 'Game console with DVD', selected Sony as the manufacturer and typed in 'Playstation 3' for the device name. It was instantly recognized.The 'Activity', as expected, makes intelligent use of Harmony's physical buttons and it adds the triangle/circle/square/x as soft buttons. I added the PS and 'Select' as the fifth and sixth soft buttons on the first page and I created a second page for the 'Eject' and 'Audio'. I didn't want 'Eject' to be on the first page in order to avoid accidents.On the Harmony side, I allowed the PS3 adapter to be controlled through the RF blasters to eliminate the need of 'pointing' the Harmony. And... that was it -10-15 minutes for the initial setup and maybe another 15-30 minutes to decide which soft buttons to add and where to place them.FINAL THOUGHTSThe PS3 adapter is a bit pricey but I think it's worth it because it eliminates the need for the last non-Harmony remote on my coffee table. Up until now, it performed flawlessly and it didn't affect the PS3 or the way it takes commands from its game controllers. For me, it's a keeper and I am so confident that it's going to do 'the job' well, I just sold my Sony PS3 remote through the Amazon marketplace which is bringing down the overall cost a little bit.","[2, 2]",Flawless,2009,10, 31,1.0,2224,388,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20091031

I had no problem getting my Sony Alpha and a few small accessories in it. While this is an adequate camera case, I decided that the Alpha will stay inside my slightly more expensiveSony LCS-AMA/B Digital SLR Carrying Case, specifically designed for it.Since there are many reviews already discussing this case, I thought I'd offer a brief comparison between the Lowepro offer and the largely similar Sony case I've been using for the past few years. I would like to make it very clear that the Sony product costs about 35% more so it being the better choice (if price was not an issue) should not be a surprise.LOOKS AND DESIGNBoth cases are black but, if placed next to each other, the Sony is larger (more room inside) and the fabric looks cheaper on the Lowepro. In addition, Sony's displays a leather-like (probably plastic) accent on the front.The Lowepro has one unprotected outside pocket which for some reason appears to be made of an even cheaper-looking nylon. A second internal pocket is protected by padding and it should probably be used to store more fragile accessories such as memory cards. Sony's 2 pockets are both external and some level of protection is achieved by the sturdier material that's lined with some thick velvety fabric on the inside. Sony's case does not have interior pockets.The Lowepro's insides are a thin grey nylon holding some protection pads in between them and the exterior wall. Sony's interior is an elegant velvety and its protection pads are not as obvious as the Lowepro's, making the Sony's the more elegant case, inside and out.Unique to the Lowepro is the rain protection cover that hides inside a secret, Velcro-locked compartment. It sounds like a good idea - when it rains, you pull out the cover and... cover your case with the camera inside. In practice, I've had my Alpha case for several years now and it's been to quite a few places and I don't remember a time when I wished I had a cover that I could use to cover my camera case. But it's good it's there.UTILITYBoth cases had no problem accepting my Alpha and I was able to find room (pockets) for the few accessories I carry: a USB cable, a memory card, a quick cleaning kit.Both cases come with an adjustable and removable shoulder strap, a grab handle (Lowepro's is padded) and a belt loop. Sony's case, while larger or rather because it is larger makes it somewhat easier to quickly get the camera in and out of it and its side pockets are easy to access. Lowepro's internal pocket may offer more protection.EVALUATIONThe Lowepro is not a bad case and I would use it if I had no alternative option. However, knowing what I know, I am going to keep Sony's as my primary camera case. If I had to make a purchase decision, I would pay more and get the Sony case. These being said, the Lowepro earns its 3 stars which, on Amazon's star scale means ""it's Okay""._____________________________________________Note:I just noticed that reviews from more than one model seem to be bundled together: 55 AW, 60 AW, 65 AW, 75 AW. THIS review is for the ZOOM 45 AW case only. The cases are quite different, it seems so I would be mindful of this. For example, one review states that you can rearrange the removable foam pads, which is nice but this is not a feature found in the 45 AW. Naturally, any comments regarding the bag's roominess should be related to the specific model.","[0, 0]",It's okay but not best in class (discussing the Zoom 45 AW model),2010,06, 3,,3470,615,Neutral,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20100603

Installation was quick and uneventful and the computer recognized the new memory immediately. My computer appears to be performing significantly better post-upgrade. I've never had an issue with Corsair memory - I also used Corsair's DD3 to upgrade my laptop's RAM - and I'm likely to continue to consider their products in the future as they appear to be of good quality and performance.Before ordering, you should make sure that this is EXACTLY what you need. This is DDR2 (two) memory. While DDR3 transfers at twice the data rate of DDR2, they are physically incompatible with DDR2 slots so you can't use the faster DDR3 memory on a DDR2 motherboard. You should also be aware that the amount of recognized available memory depends on the operating system and the way your computer is configured (BIOS) so you may not be able to use the all the memory in your system until you install a 64-bit OS and/or upgrade your BIOS.My STRONG suggestion (I got burned myself once): don't make assumptions and hope for the best, verify that your specific machine supports this exact type of memory before you buy. Corsair has a site that can help you determine that and your computer manual should list its specs.To me, it's an easy 5 stars.Specs:- Memory clock @ 200 MHz- I/O bus clock @ 400 MHz- Peak transfer rate: 6400 MB/s- Cycle time: 5 ns- Limited (what does it mean?) lifetime warranty but there is no warranty statement- Made in Taiwan________________________________Note: at the time I bought mine, Corsair was offering a rebate but I can't remember if there was an expiration date.","[20, 22]","This was an easy, not so expensive upgrade",2010,05, 21,0.9090909090909091,1746,300,Positive,20,22,2,0.022992997883080932,20100521

It is so because what you get is a bad portable TV with a dual personality, its second being that of an absolutely terrible, awful media player. This product should not have been made or sold.I will first list the good things about this item, because not everything is bad, followed by the more disappointing aspects concerning the Tivax experience.THE GOOD- Nice packaging. The TV comes surrounded by a very substantial air-filled, cushion sleeve or pocket. It should be next to impossible for it to get scratched or in any way damaged during transportation.- Good looks. From a distance, the Tivax looks quite okay.- Many accessories included: rechargeable batteries, antenna, headphones, AV cables, power adapter, remote control. A docking station and a carrying case can be purchased as 'extras' if needed.- Good I/O. Besides the antenna port, it comes with USB, SD card interface, headphones, audio in and video in ports.- Stereo speakers, not bad for such a small TV.THE BAD- The resolution is terrible. For a TV that has HiRez7 in its name, the very low resolution is a big disappointment. I couldn't find anyplace in the manual a reference to the actual screen resolution but I suspect it's less than 200 lines.- The antenna port does not allow for a 'regular' antenna to plug in. The coax connectors tend to be wider that the orifice provided and it's not easy to find something that fits.- The supplied antenna - the size of my index finger is useless. I got about the same signal strength on this TV with or without it.- The menu system - sequence of buttons to press to get things done is not always intuitive. After some practice one learns it but... is it really worth it?- The TV's ability to play music is a joke. The speakers quality is terrible.- The supplied headphones are probably the cheapest you would ever use.- The TV's ability to play movies off an SD card or USB drive is, again a joke - see my comments on low resolution and poor speakers quality.- The TV's ability to display pictures is another joke. There is very little control over what plays, the resolution is low and, incredibly, when set to a 16*9 mode it will stretch all pictures - the only way to display them correctly is in a 4*3 mode which begs the 'why' question, as in 'why bother with a wide screen TV if it can't display properly?'.In practice, I was able to put together an antenna with a connector that actually plugs into the TV's port and was able to get a couple of channels. The experience was underwhelming, to say the list. Did I mention low resolution and cheap little speakers already? I purchased this items on one of Amazon's lightning deals so I didn't pay a lot but, knowing what I know now, I would not buy this TV for half the price. The only practical use we found for it was as a cheap, feature-poor photo frame, endlessly cycling through a couple thousand photos stored on an SD card, sitting on the kitchen counter. You can get a lot better for a lot less if you buy a dedicated picture frame.","[2, 2]",Just terrible,2010,02, 8,1.0,3145,567,Negative,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20100208

I like it but anyone considering it should be aware that this case does not travel well - see below.The most interesting feature about the case is the design, so to speak. If you can imagine your HDD inside a box ofAltoids Curiously Strong Mintsand you don't mind it being there then this case is for you. There are no screws or hinges or locks and none are needed for as long as your case doesn't move much. What you get is a little tin box where you press the top part on after you literally squeeze in your 2.5 SATA drive and it kind of clicks in and it stays that way because it's not easy to reopen it.This is great design - how come no one else thought of it? - and I applaud it but, like I said, I would not carry this case in my shirt pocket or even in my laptop bag. Murphy's law being what it is, the lid just might pop open and the HDD may come out and, in the process, maybe damage the case own USB interface or, worse, its own connectors, making itself useless. However, as a stationary external HDD solution, it's tops on the price/performance curve.- INSTALLATION - Without exaggeration, it took less than 2 minutes, most of the time spent to actually open the empty box because it comes closed. Must be careful with those connectors but that's all. Once you snap in the lid, your drive is encased and ready to use. On a Vista and on a Windows 7 computer it was recognized within seconds.- CONTENTS - Other than the tin/aluminum case, you get a little USB cable to connect to your computer [mine was junk - see my note below]. It's split for 2 'A' (wider connectors), just in case your HDD needs to draw power from 2 USB ports but my 500GB, 2.5"" SATA is happy with just one. You should make sure that your HDD is connected to a 'powered' USB port - some USB port splitters/hubs do not power all or some of their ports. There is also a postage-sized manual that discusses setup under Windows 98 or Windows 2000 and when it's safe to disconnect the drive - the English is a solid B+. I don't believe I found any warranty promises but warranties on items this inexpensive are silly to begin with. There is also some cheap neoprene-like pouch, presumably to be used while traveling. It's actually a good thing to have, IF you insist on taking your encased disc on the road because it improves the odds of keeping the whole thing together - remember, there are no screws.- PERFORMACE - For a stationary drive, it fully meets my expectation. The interface is USB 2.0 so you should expect way over 100MB/s when it comes to data rates. The aluminum/tin case, being metal, is quite good at dissipating heat and the disc seems to be running pretty cool inside.I am very happy with this inexpensive case and I will consider getting more if I end up with more loose 2.5"" SATAs (it happens when you upgrade or your old laptop turns obsolete) and decide to use them as stationary external HDDs or simply to store the discs and put them away for data archiving while keeping easy access to the data via the USB port.____________________________Note:After posting the review above where the case was used with one of my own USB cable, I actually used the supplied 'free' USB wire and, to my surprise, the disc was either not recognized, I was being prompted to format the perfectly good disc or, from time to time, it WAS recognized. On occasions, the LED would blink red indicating that the the disc was 'writing' something (scary) and it would not stop unless I turned off the computer.To make the story short, IF you are having trouble connecting the disc to your computer with the supplied USB wire, the first thing you should do is try another USB cable. I hope that most of the USB cables shipped are good but... you never now. I'm taking a star away for the scare I got - asking me to 'format' a perfectly good drive.","[51, 55]","Not ideal for travel but perfect to host a stationary, external HDD - included USB cable was junk",2010,04, 9,0.9272727272727272,3889,722,Positive,51,55,4,0.023937469467513434,20100409

I also have an issue with the 'Ultra High Speed' designation. While the HDMI consortium does define 'High Speed' and 'Category 2', the 'Ultra' addition seems to be the product of over-zealous marketing from some vendors too eager to differentiate their product and to justify higher prices.Just to clear any doubt, this cable works as well as any other 6 ft. HDMI wire, including the premium ones and it's no better than those that sell at Amazon for one penny (I actually have one in use right now). The one advantage of this semi-premium-priced wire over the 'regular' ones is some extra shielding which, in the event of an airburst (EMP) above one's residence would ensure that the TV continues to get a clear picture.AmazonBasics vs. Other Discount Brands--------------------------------------It's not an easy call between an AmazonBasics-branded wire and someone else's that sells for less (plus shipping :) ) but, here's why I went with Amazon this time.If you look carefully, you will find the probably hundreds of HDMI 'brands' offered at Amazon (exclude the 'premium') fall in about 3 'types' as far as pricing:a - in the single-digits plus shippingb - in the mid to high single digits that qualify for Super Savers free shippingc - listed for as low as pennies plus shippingThis product may compete with 'a' on price but not with categories 'b' and 'c'. Category 'c' saves you a few dollars - and I did order a couple of these myself as well as one of the less expensive Amazon cables:AmazonBasics  High Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet / 2.0 Meters) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging].Amazon has a few extra advantages worth considering if you don't mind paying a little extra.- EASY RETURN - I know because I had to return quite a few items for various reasons. Amazon makes it very easy and, if you are returning the item because it came defective or damaged Amazon pays for shipping.- WARRANTY - these wires come with a 1-year warranty (talking about future-proofing). If an HDMI cable performs for one year, the ods that it would stop working after that are pretty close to zero. It's possible that the other vendors back their inexpensive cables too (I never checked) but I am highly confident that Amazon will be around to honor its warranty and I'm not so sure about vendors I know less.- QUALITY ASSURANCE - I've never had any problems with 'cheap' HDMI cables but it may be reassuring to have Amazon's name on a wire. My assumption is that Amazon did insist on some quality checks before they stamped their logo on the product.HDMI Background and the FUD of Premium Cables---------------------------------------------Let's face it, HDMI 1.3x cables have become a commodity these days. There are 'premium' brands, for sure and some look prettier than others (for something that goes to the back of your equipment and no one else will probably see) but the fact is that nearly all of today's makes and models qualify for 'high-speed' or 'Category 2' (see HDMI 1.3 specs below). Just to eliminate the confusion, it's worth stating that:- Practically all HDMI 1.3x certified cables are HIGH-SPEED or CATEGORY 2. Only the Category 2 (high-speed) cables support 1080p resolutions.- The HDMI official site advises that even HDMI cables under 15 ft. (5m) that were made BEFORE the HDMI 1.3 specification can work as Category 2 cables. The FUD claim that signal attenuation is less over a more expensive cable may be true, nut that's irrelevant on a 6 ft. length.- The 'ultra high-speed' claim that some premium brands make means very little or 'nothing'. As far as I know, there is NO official HDMI specification for 'ultra high-speed' and, every time I checked the specs of cables labelled as 'ultra', all I saw was the familiar HDMI 1.3 specifications and nothing more.- The 'premium', very expensive HDMI cables are NOT 'future proof'. The HDMI 1.4 specs that add an Ethernet channel, an audio return channel, support for 3-D and 4K by 2K resolution use a physically different connector - in other words, the highly-expensive and the ultra-expensive 'premium' cables do NOT work with HDMI 1.4.- At this length - 6 ft., you will get as good a service from a no-brand or Amazon-labeled cable as you would from a super-expensive rip-off. Any HDMI 1.3 cable should be able to carry, error free, all the signal your electronic equipment may put out.________________________________________Here are the HDMI 1.3 specs supported by this cable the premium brands and the less expensive alternatives:Maximum signal bandwidth (MHz) 340Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s) 10.2Maximum video bandwidth (Gbit/s) 8.16Maximum audio bandwidth (Mbit/s) 36.86Maximum Color Depth (bit/px) 48Maximum resolution over single link at 24-bit/px 25601600p75Maximum resolution over single link at 30-bit/px 25601600p60Maximum resolution over single link at 36-bit/px 1920x1200p75Maximum resolution over single link at 48-bit/px 19201200p60sRGBYCbCr8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio capabilityBlu-ray Disc video and audio at full resolutionConsumer Electronic Control (CEC)DVD-Audio supportSuper Audio CD (DSD) supportDeep ColorxvYCCAuto lip-syncDolby TrueHD bitstream capableDTS-HD Master Audio bitstream capableUpdated list of CEC commands (only on HDMI 1.3a,b,c)________________________________________","[186, 226]","AmazonBasics ULTRA HIGH SPEED HDMI BRAIDED - Gets Amazon's full support, shielding unneeded - Amazon offers better alternatives",2009,10, 4,0.8230088495575221,5618,898,Negative,186,226,40,0.02716170004885198,20091004

I wouldn't call myself an Onkyo fan when it comes to entertainment devices - Sony receiver, Sony PS3, Sony BD player, Samsung TV - but I am aware of Onkyo's reputation for quality and this set of speakers doesn't disappoint.All prospective buyers should be aware that these are 6 Ohm (SIX OHM) speakers. They will work well with 6 Ohm receivers, of course, and you SHOULD be able to use them with an 8 Ohm receiver if it's kept in a well-ventilated shelf and you don't keep it continuously at full blast. My own receiver is 8 Ohm and it seems to be Okay but both Onkyo and the receiver maker may not want to honor the warranty if they get word of this.CONTENTSWhat you get is good quality, 130W speakers encased in well-built wood boxes, a 290W powered woofer and then, there are a couple of unexpected bonuses.- 1 Center speaker, surprisingly large- 2 Front speakers on 'tower' stands (tallboy) - will save you money on speaker stands but if you're thinking about hanging them, this is not your set.- 4 Satellite speakers - do have hanging holes- 1 Woofer - powered, connects through 'banana' jacks on both ends- Color-coded wires for each speaker - kind of thin and I used my own, see below but... they're free-Onkyo UP-A1 Dock for the iPod- this was totally unexpectedSETUPA screwdriver will be needed to attach the heavy metal base to the front, floor-standing speakers.If you go with the color-coded wires, connecting everything is easy. I decided that I wanted thicker, copper speaker wire so I went withACOUSTIC RESEARCH AP-16100W 100'  White 16 Gauge Oxygen-Free Speaker Wireand I'm happy I did that. The 100 ft. spool was about 25 ft. short of what I needed so, until I get another 25 ft., one of my satellite speakers will be using the Onkyo-supplied wire so I'm happy they included these.The center and satellite speakers have mounting holes in the back but not on the base. I like my center speaker to sit on top of the TV and that was accomplished with about 1 ft. of Velcro 2""-wide tape. I used Velcro on the 4 stands as well as, in my view, it preserves the speaker's integrity and it even offers some cushioning.I do not own an iPod or an Onkyo receiver so the iPod Dock I am trying to sell at Amazon. Hopefully, there will be a buyer and that should help reduce the overall cost of this set.THE EXPERIENCEI only have good things to say about this set. For what I paid, it fully meets my expectation. The sound is full, crisp and if there are any distortions my ear is not trained or sensitive enough to detect them.Physically, the boxes look professionally built and designed, uncompromising black matte with the sides of the center, the top of the front speakers and the woofer's front a perfect shiny polish - don't touch them  or the fingerprints could be seen from a distance. The tall front pair is stable even on my carpeted floor.RATINGThis set deserves its 5 stars well for delivering good quality, well-built speakers and the couple of extras - wires, iPod dock. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a 7.1 set of 6 Ohm speakers.","[110, 113]",Good quality/build plus some extras add up to great value,2009,10, 16,0.9734513274336283,3151,567,Positive,110,113,3,0.025891548607718612,20091016

What you get if you purchase this item is the standard, somewhat dated - as in 'small capacity' - MicroSD card. At the time of this review, the 8/16GB size may offer more value if cost per GB is considered. My strategy when shopping for a memory card is to first determine the capacity I need, then shop for price and, on something this inexpensive, I would make sure to factor in the shipping charge.PERFORMANCEThis card's 'Class 4' speed is the equivalent of a CD's 26x speed rating and should guarantee a MINIMUM of 4MB/s - more than enough when it comes to music playback or slideshows on a small screen but not always sufficient when playing a video. Unlike the 'x' ratings, the speed class ratings are NOT certified by an independent body so you will have to decide whether you trust the card's maker - Kingston is quite a reputable brand so I would not dispute their rating.Practically, if you are going to use this card in a Blackberry, it should be more than adequate for playing music and you should do well with most video for as long as the resolution and the frame rates are not too high. If you need better performance, look for a higher 'class' number 133x/Class 20, for example, should support 20 MB/s or writing up to 10 12-megapixel JPG photo files per second.ADDITIONAL FEATURES/CONCERNSThe card comes with a 'full' SDHC adapter. This can be helpful if you need to interface with a computer. You may still need a USB card reader to interface with the SDHC if your computer lacks a SDHC interface or you may access the card by connecting the device itself (phone, camera) to the computer.RATINGA memory card can distinguish itself through reliability, speed, capacity and price. The Kingston brand name should give this card some assurance when it comes to reliability. Its speed and capacity are no longer tops, in fact they are a little below par and the price is more or less where most cards of these specs sell for these days. A 3-stars rating at Amazon means ""It's Okay"". There's nothing wrong with this card for as long as a low cost, low capacity, relatively low speed card is what's needed. I am using Class 4 MicroSD and SDHC cards myself in MP3 players and picture frames but at this time 8GB would be the minimum size I would pay for.","[7, 7]",Standard MicroSD - a little outdated on speed/capacity at the time of this review,2010,04, 26,1.0,2566,459,Neutral,7,7,0,0.022634750040709983,20100426

So far, I was unable to identify any potential weak spots, prone to breaking or tearing. It can probably easily accommodate a multiple of the maximum weight anyone is ever likely to carry.I liked the easily-adjustable but non-removable shoulder strap - it's really the only way you can carry your load. I was also a little surprised to see ONE handle on the back of the bag because I can't think of any situation where I would use it.The bag looks quite stylish in a unisex way and the 2-style flap allows some flexibility in looks. Additional flaps are available at the Web side, if you are willing to pay almost as much for the 'extra' as you did for the whole bag. Most extra flaps are just different color and texture combinations.FUNCTIONALITY AND ERGONOMICSThe bag is 10.5"" wide, 12.5"" tall and about 2"" thick. The above dimensions make it a perfect fit for most netbooks. The computer compartment comes with some VERY effective padding that should offer pretty good protection. The bottom pads are especially thick but the walls and corners come with some serious reinforcements too. These combined with the tight fit should make the Brenthaven product one of the better if not the best netbook case when it comes to protecting it from falls or other shocks.The bag comes with a number of additional pocket. On the side covered by the flap, there is a zippered pocket that goes 2/3 the height of the body and an 'open' pocket with holders for 2 pens and what could be credit cards. On the opposite side, there is a Velcroed pocket that is not so easily accessible. Between these 3, one can carry along little wires, thumb drives, some papers but there is no room for a DC adapter or anything that's fragile other than the netbook itself. 8.5""x11""papers must be 'squeezed' to fit in the open pocket but they won't fit in easily - European design?.The bag is light enough to be a comfortable or tolerable load on the shoulder, even when loaded. However, the shoulder strap is NOT padded.MARKETING CLAIMSA card that comes with the bag claims that the bag has 'zero impact on the environment'. This is quite surprising for a bag that's nearly-100%, probably highly resistant to natural degradation plastic - and we all know where plastic comes from. It turns out that, if you register your purchase at their Web site and you provide some personal information, Brenthaven may buy some 'carbon credits'. Not clear why they won't buy them regardless and not clear how those credits would clean the air. Perhaps not having the bag 'Made in China' would have protected the environment better than buying some electronic credits and kept some of our fellow shoppers employed - surely, at this price, the bag could have been handmade in the US at a union shop and still be sold at a nice profit.Another claim made is that there bag will have 'zero impact on your health' because the shoulder strap is padded - it is NOT - and because the handles distribute the weight across the entire hand - there are no handles, there's only one and it can't be used for anything practical.Finally, there's a claim of 'zero impact' on the computer.

And, yes, if you don't expect HD video and Hi-Fi sound from a 7-dollar camera, you are right because you are not going to get it. What you get is 'decent' video and 'okay' sound. The 6-LED lights which you can turn off if you don't need are a nice feature. The focus, on the other hand, is something that you should set once and leave it that way because you need to manually twist the lens at the risk of seeing the camera disintegrating into 'parts' that are hard to reassemble.The worse thing about this camera is the way it's physically put together. If you look at the picture you may notice that you are dealing with 4 separate 'parts': stand, the body of the camera and 2 (right/left) parts for the part in-between and they are all (barely) held together with ONE butterfly screw. Every time you try to readjust it you risk it all falling apart and having to spend another 5 minutes putting it back together. Which is why the way to avoid trouble is to set up the camera for one specific spot and refrain from touch it.I do not regret this purchase because I expected worse considering the low price. However, this is NOT a 'good' camera. The sound and picture are only 'okay' and there's always a risk trying to readjust the focus or to move the camera around. 3 stars, meaning ""it's Okay"" is probably the fair rating but, depending on expectations, you may love it or you may hate it.","[1, 1]","It's okay, considering the price",2011,05, 14,1.0,1755,332,Neutral,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20110514

The ear-tips fit inside the ear canal and muffle all but the loudest outside noise therefore making them an excellent 'at home' listening option but probably not recommended while driving or even walking. The 4 ft. long chord is perfect for listening off an iPod but may not be long enough if one wants to plug then into a computer.THE LONG DISCUSSION:====================Personal bias and circumstances-------------------------------For the sake of honest disclosure, I do not consider myself an audiophile. I do listen to music and I do use earphones while in the office but most of my listening comes from open speakers. Since most of my listening is done either in the car or in the office where I must be aware of my surroundings, I will not use these earphones. This is GREAT news for my kids who are jumping up and down with joy because they tried them out and they absolutely LOVE them.Contents--------You get the following in the box:- Earphones- 3 pairs of different size ear tip gels (small, medium, large)- Ear tip cleaning tool- A 'snap' carrying, black-velvety pouch- Multi-language manual/warranty statement pageEvaluation----------- The following are my views on manufacturer's claims and they seem to hold true:[MOSTLY TRUE] - Great bass, dynamic in-ear headphones. - The sound quality, bass included is satisfactory but if you are looking for TRULY-great bass then you should go at least one notch upscale (See my note on the S4s).[TRUE] - Noise-isolating. - These are not noise-cancelling earphones. By simply stuffing the ear tip gels into your ears you no longer hear most of the sounds produced by the outside world.[TRUE] - Comfortable. - I have a low tolerance to in-ear headphones but, to my surprise, I enjoyed wearing these for extended periods.[TRUE] - Compact design. - They are, indeed small.[MOSTLY TRUE] - Feel your music, not your earphones. - As I stated already, they are comfortable. I can't say that I can't feel them but I have no problem tolerating them.- The 2 year warranty provides for replacement or repair of the earphones IF you are the original purchaser, can prove it and you didn't abuse them in some unspecified way. However, the warranty does NOT cover the wires or the connector so, if the wire breaks, you're out of luck.S2 vs. S4---------Would the S4 be worth the extra expense or are you really saving by going with the S2?The answer is - if you are REALLY into great sound, go with the S4. The big difference between the two is that the S4 seems to have miniaturized sub-woofers added and even I can hear the difference. If you don't care much about bass, then they are really the same.The other difference is that the S4 comes with a metal carrying case which is nice while the S2 has the velvety pouch. I like the pouch myself because it's so much smaller so it's 'advantage S2' in MY book as far as the pouch vs. the metal box is concerned but not everyone may agree.If I could afford the extra expense I'd go for the S4 - you actually get 'something' other than 'image' for the extra money, it's not a gimmick.Rating------With the exception of the rather strange warranty limitation, I find these to be VERY good at their price point. While they don't approach the level of a $200 or $1000 earphones set, the sound quality is actually good and most of the outside noise is successfully muffled or eliminated. The snappy pouch is a BIG plus because it allows for keeping everything in one place and I don't understand why many similar products in the $100 price range don't provide this convenience. The wires are a little fragile and, unless treated with care they COULD break.My overall rating is 4 stars because I believe that the closely related Klipsch IMAGE S4 delivers more value in the form of enhanced-bass listening pleasure.","[8, 8]",Pretty good at this price - my kids love them,2009,10, 20,1.0,3955,672,Positive,8,8,0,0.022667318026380067,20091020

When attached to one of the kids' laptops and fired up to near-full 40W unstoppable power, they make the movie watching or even the Youtube watching experience significantly more enjoyable.I liked this set of speakers for:- Ease of installation - 10 minutes tops with hardly a need to check the folded-paper, tri-lingual manual.- The subwoofer, of course.- Its versatility: headphones output and inputs either from a computer, MP3 player or even an Xbox, PS3 or a DVD player via an RCA wire (not included)- Half-decent sound. You wouldn't expect anything approaching hi-fi from this class of devices but, if you keep the volume somewhere in-between, what comes out is almost okay.Of course, not all is perfect.

It will work with third generation Kindles (possibly with second gens too but I don't have one to verify), Blackberries such as Bold or Storm, many of the newer phones and other gadgets. I needed one of these to connect one camera to the computer because I lost the original when someone 'found' my camera case. It works.On this specific cable, it is USB 2.0 certified, meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480 Mbps and, if your device accepts a standard Micro-B plug, this is the one to get. Maybe the 2-meter length (6+ ft.) is a little too long but it does not bother me a lot and there may come a time when a cable this long may come in handy.I am awarding this item 5 stars mostly for the low price. It's low enough to make it easy for anyone concerned about quality to buy two.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a later model (post 2009-10) and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need. Whenever in doubt, do some more research, beginning with the product's manual.","[162, 166]",Ahhh... generics,2011,04, 17,0.9759036144578314,2054,371,Positive,162,166,4,0.027552515876893013,20110417

Dent ""Aragorn""",1253577600,5.0,B002IC0YL8,"09 22, 2009","BRIEF EVALUATIONThe Harmony 900 can replace all infrared (IR) remotes used to control the various devices associated to an entertainment center. Once configured, its activity-centric interface effectively shields the user(s) from  having to explicitly control individual devices, unless they want to. The Harmony will allow 'everyone', including the less technical members of a household to get the most off an entertainment center's capabilities without having to worry about switching the remote's 'modes' or remembering the correct I/O ports before watching a Blu-ray movie, watching TV or listening to the radio.As compared to its immediate predecessor models (880, 890), the Harmony 900 offers a number of incremental but generally welcome improvements or changes- Ergonomic shape, well-balanced body with sculpted buttons for a tactile feel.- Surprisingly good, hi-res, full color touch screen that allows for up to 6, context defined 'soft' buttons.- Included IR Blasters that make controlling devices behind walls or inside locked cabinets possible and improve remote's ease of use - no need to 'point' the remote.- Better designed, wider charger base.The new Harmony 900 is an elegant and efficient way to operate one's audio-visual equipment and it's should be a 'must have' for anyone who can can afford it. PS3 owners should be aware that Harmony's lack of Bluetooth support will require the purchase of another add-on.PACKAGING AND PHYSICAL SETUPThe Harmony 900 comes in a well-partitioned box that keeps the various components well-protected during shipping and makes it relatively easy to open and access its contents.The following are included:- Remote's body- Charging base- Remote's rechargeable battery- IR master blaster- 2 Mini Blasters- 2 Power Adapters (one for the charger and one for the IR blaster)- 5-ft. USB cable- System software on a DVD- Multi-lingual poster-style manualPutting it together is as easy as inserting the battery into the remote control - it's designed such that you can't do it wrong, attaching the power adapter wire to the charging stand and then performing the initial charge.CONFIGURATIONAn Internet-connected computer with a USB port will be needed to install the software and configure the remote. Once installed and an account is established, the software will guide the user, step by step through all the configuration/setup activities.[To make setup quicker and easier, one should have the EXACT make and model number (like Sony KDL-70XBR7, not just Sony Bravia) for all the devices about to be registered or one will have to go through a time consuming process involving 'teaching' the Harmony what every button on the unrecognized device's remote does.]Once all devices are registered and recognized, the software will suggest a series of 'activities' that it believes you should be able to perform with the registered devices. You can accept them all and then refine your requirements, remove some or add some of your own. For the basic setup to complete, Harmony will need to know which devices need to be on, which specific device is to be controlled when turning the volume up or down (TV or receiver) or changing the channel (cable box or TV) and which specific ports/channels are used (HDMI-1 or Satellite-IN)After the basic setup is completed and tested, it's possible to further customize your activities. Typically, you will add 'favorite' channels to the touch screen. For reasons I can't understand, the only 'channel' icons Harmony carries are for a number of FOX outlets but Harmony-compatible icons for most known channels (other than C-SPAN) I could find at a site whose URL I posted as the first 'comment' made to this post (can't post URLs inside the review). Optionally, you can add some 'soft' buttons for each device if the remote does not have physical buttons for all the available functions.It is also possible to customize the way your remote behaves: several color schemes are available, you can decide for how long the 900 will stay lit after a button is pressed, whether the 'favorite channels' or the 'controls' are displayed by default when a TV-related activity is selected, you can add custom commands as 'soft buttons' on the touch screen or change the default mapping of physical buttons to different commands.Further fine tuning can be done to change the default buttons mapping for any registered device or even to establish the exact order in which the various components are turned on and off and, if needed, set specific delays between specific steps performed to start a particular 'activity'.Even when there aren't any devices behind walls or inside cabinets, the Blasters can be used to enhance the user's experience. By placing these IR-generating devices (one big 'master' and two attached 'mini blasters') on the shelf/shelves or inside the cabinets you no longer need to worry about pointing 'at' whatever it is you want to operate because the Blasters communicate with the remote via radio (RF) which means no need to point and less severe distance restrictions. The Blaster use is an either-or proposition for any individual device. For example, Harmony allowed me to exempt the AV receiver from the Blaster treatment (it was not responding to Blaster commands reliably), meaning that everything but the AV receiver could be controlled through the Blaster while the receiver was getting 'traditional' IR commands from the remote.While it's true that the initial setup can be completed in about one hour, I found that the more I use the Harmony the more I think of further refinements so it can take several setup refining sessions over several days before the configuration could be called 'stable'. Once that's accomplished, everything is set more or less on 'automatic pilot' and there's very little to worry and a lot to enjoy. Once used to the 'cycle', updating is easy: fire up the software, enter changes, connect the remote to the computer and get it updated.THE EXPERIENCEAnyone watching a Harmony at work for the first time should be impressed. I know that I was when I first used my Harmony 880 a year or so ago. It's almost like it's talking with the TV, the satellite receiver, the Blu-ray player, the AV receiver box. Devices turn themselves on or off as needed as you switch from one 'activity' to another, they reconfigure themselves, opening the proper input or output channels and the Harmony appears to conduct 2-way communication sessions with each one of them individually - probably not true since, as far as I know, IR controllers don't get feedback from the devices they control - if anyone knows otherwise, please correct me.Once set up, the typical interaction with the remote is to select an 'activity' and then enjoy the show. The Harmony will turn off the devices not needed for the activity, turn on and properly set up those that must be on, set up the soft buttons on the touch screen  and map the 'hard' buttons to various functions. To switch to a different activity, simply touch the 'activity' button, then select the desired activity from the touch screen and the Harmony will go through a similar cycle. To turn everything off, touch the 'off' button and everything is turned off unless the setup asked the Harmony to keep certain devices 'on' all the time - the satellite box, for example.Whenever the Harmony makes a mistake or gets confused about the status of a particular device, pressing the Help button will place the Harmony in a troubleshooting mode. It will try to interactively fix the problem or, if the user knows exactly what to do, telling Harmony 'I know how to fix this' will give the user the opportunity to address the problem without assistance.Besides 'activities', it is possible to command a specific device, independently. And, of course, the Harmony's own settings can be tweaked to some degree - and for minor, remote specific changes such as the color scheme, the setup can be performed on the remote directly - no need to connect it to a computer.Unlike its immediate predecessors, the Harmony 900 designers opted for the 'groovy' look. Sculpted, well-defined buttons, instead of the smooth styling of the 880 and 890. Just about every button you would expect on a respectable remote is there, including the 4 'colored' buttons used with some satellite/cable boxes and Blu-ray players. Since Harmony 'knows' a lot about all the devices it works with - it loads data from a 200,000 electronic devices database - the functions usually map correctly to the expected Harmony button. In addition, the full color touch screen allows for 6 additional 'soft' buttons to be visible at any given time and, if more than 6 buttons are needed, it's possible to 'flip' page after page of more buttons - there are 'touch' page-flipping buttons to the right and left of the touch screen. In our case, we used 4 pages worth of 'favorite channels' so we have 'my' page, a movies channels page, the kids page and Ms. D's page - most convenient.The remote lights up whenever a button or the screen are pressed or when the remote is moved, shaken or rattled (gently, hopefully). It would stay lit for up to 30 seconds (configurable) if nothing else is done to it, waiting for additional commands. Clearly, the shape was scientifically determined to fit the average human hand as comfortably as possible - it feels well balanced and comfortable to hold and it's easy to pick up from a table or from your armchair's arm. When not in use, the preferred resting place should be the charging cradle which holds it securely until it's needed again.WARRANTY AND SUPPORTThe one year limited warranty appears to be standard. Harmony reserves the right to replace your unit or parts of it with either new or refurbished components at its own discretion. You are not covered if you abuse your Harmony and, depending on local laws and regulations you may or may not have to pay for shipping the device back and forth.Once you register your Harmony, you are entitled to 90-day free phone support. This should be sufficient to address whatever issues you may have with the setup. Based on my prior experience with the 880, once configured, there's hardly any need to make further changes for as long as you don't add new devices to your entertainment center so 90 days of support should be enough. After that, support is available for a fee. I never required any assistance for my 880 and I am still within the 90-day free support with the 900.ISSUESLike everything else, the Harmony 900 is not perfect. I probably hinted at some problems above but it may not hurt to list them all in one place.- It's a fingerprint magnet. Unlike its 880/890 sisters, the 900's shiny black surface not only takes fingerprints, it's attracting them and it's  showing them off, possibly in duplicate (kidding). The 900 looks elegant and pretty when clean but all it takes is one touch for much the prettiness to go away and you MUST touch the 'touch' screen or you won't be able to do much.- Lack of Bluetooth support requires to purchase an extra module for controlling a PS3 if you have one. I have one.- No more than 4 screens of favorite channels (for a total of 24) per TV activity.- The software does not support more than one Harmony device per account if they are to be configured independently. The requirement for separate accounts makes maintaining more that one Harmony device more difficult than it should be. Granted, at the price the Harmonies sell, this is not likely to be an issue for too many users.- The IR Blaster stays on at all times - the only way to turn it off is to unplug it.- Price, of course. How many people will be willing to pay more than they paid for their PS3 to be able to control 'it' and the devices surrounding it? Hard to tell.RATINGI already discussed why using a Harmony 900 makes for such a satisfying experience:- it simplifies life by eliminating the need of keeping numerous remote controls handy- it saves time and reduces frustrations- it allows those less technologically sophisticated (think children) to take full advantage of technologyTwo of the issues that I listed above - need of an add-on for PS3 support and complications when managing more than one Harmony device - are not likely to affect most Harmony users.I will not factor in 'price' when rating the Harmony 900 because prices can change and because the review guidelines state that I shouldn't. By the way, I was able to get my old 880 for VERY LITTLE when it showed up for a couple of hours as a 'lightning deal', refurbished, so prices can and do vary.The 'fingerprint magnet' problem is real. It's possible that not everyone cares about it but it annoys me a lot. I will deduct half a star for that but the rounded up score is going to be a 5-star, given that individual reviews don't allow for half star increments.Please note that (again) I did not factor in 'price', I did not need warranty repairs and my interaction with customer support was very limited._____________________________________________________________Note: HARMONY 900 vs. HARMONY 880 vs. HARMONY ONESince I happen to own both the 880 and the 900 at this time and I saw the ONE in action at a friend's house, a brief comparison may help some decide on which model to pick.Advantage 900 over 880----------------------- IR blasters make control of out-of-side devices possible (can get as add-ons separately for the 880)- Sculpted buttons provide better tactile feedback- Touch-screen allows for a lot of flexibility in configuration- Higher screen resolution- Better designed shape- (Apparently) better charging unit. The 880 known to experience 'charger' problems.Advantage 880 over 900----------------------- Price- Matte surface does not show fingerprintsAdvantage 900 over ONE----------------------- Yellow/Red/Green/Blue keys on the remote- BlastersAdvantage ONE over 900----------------------- Price_____________________________________________________________CUSTOMER SUPPORTI am adding this section after a few weeks and two customer support calls because I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and professionalism of Logitech's customer support team.While it is true that, in both cases, it took more than 15 minutes for someone to actually pick up the phone, my issues - both having to do with programming the remote - were resolved quickly and to my complete satisfaction by the support person directly modifying my setup and, in both cases, the calls ended with some pretty useful advice.Of course, it should be noted that 'free' support by humans is only available for the first 90 days. After that, it's the knowledge base or paying for human assistance.","[258, 277]","Not unlike previous Harmony remote models, only better",2009,09, 22,0.9314079422382672,14675,2420,Positive,258,277,19,0.030190522716170006,20090922

I am currently using several Western Digital HDDs and I found them to be well built, quality, reliable products. As an 'External Hard Drive', WD is that way too (more below) but I found the SmartWare backup application that comes 'burned' on a solid state drive to be a dubious 'continuous backup solution' at best which HAD to be removed from my computer.CONTENTS AND SPECS:Out of the box you get:- The MyBook HDD, in a well-ventilated, shiny-black plastic enclosure.- AC adapter- USB wire- Quick installation guideThis is a USB 2.0 device, meaning that it operates at up to 480 Mbps (fast). However, if your computer has a USB 1.1 port, you can still use the drive, it's only 40 times slower at 12 Mbps.On the back of the drive, besides the USB port and the power connector, there is a power button (not very responsive) and a Kensignton security slot. On the front, you have a power light, a 'lock' indicator and an illuminated capacity gauge that shows you how full your drive is in increments of 25%.MyBook comes formatted as NTFS but it's easy to repartition and reformat it if needed.As an external AC-powered USB 2.0 HDD, MyBook Essential performs flawlessly. In fact, it's already attached to my media server and it's doing great there.THE TROUBLE WITH SMARTWAREThe first time you plug the drive into your computer, you will see TWO new drives popping up: the expected 900 GB or so MyBook and another smaller drive labelled SmartWare. The second drive hosts WD's software that's should provide you worry-free, safe, continuous backup of all your non-system files and even categorize them as 'music, documents, mail, and so forth' in addition to the ability to password-protect your drive.I've tested this on a Lenovo T400 Windows 7 Enterprise laptop with 4GB or RAM and a pretty speedy dual-core CPU and, shortly thereafter, I decided to remove SmartWare from my computer and use WD's MyBook as a 'dumb' 1 TB drive on my media server.SmartWare does, in fact back up your computer's files but, in my case, the 'worry free' promise did not materialize. The backup was no longer working when I re-attached my laptop to its docking station and it could only restart after I rebooted my machine. In addition, even though set to perform backups only when the computer was 'idle' the overhead seemed to be enormous. It was near-impossible to use my computer while the WD drive was attached and SmartWare was running. Worse, apps were freezing, crashing or wouldn't even start and my previously reliable Windows 7 machine gave up completely. Once I uninstalled SmartWare, everything was back to normal again.For anyone who doesn't mind the overhead, besides the backup, SmartWare also allows you to password-protect your drive. This may be a needed feature for some users but, at least as an NTFS-formatted drive, there are many ways of protecting one's data besides password-protecting the drive so that feature should not be missed.As far as SmartWare's features are concerned, once the backup was complete I attempted to restore 'something'. Restoring ALL files or manually selecting the files or folders I wanted restored was easy. However, all attempts at searching for a specific file or even sorting the backup files by name, size or 'last modified' failed. I am not sure whether this was a failure of design or the application simply could not fulfill my request because it was constantly on the verge of crashing. It was good to know that you could have several versions of the same file stored on the drive, ready to be restored but, sadly this did not work for me.SOME PRACTICAL BITSAs I mentioned already, you are going to see TWO drives when you attach the MyBook to your system. SmartWare will allow you to make the SmartWare drive invisible but... you must install SmartWare first. You will also need SmartWare if you want easy access to the online 80-page manual.Luckily, there is a way to 'hide' the SmartWare drive without actually installing the software - see my comment to this review for the URL. I will also provide there the path to the drive's manual so that you may be able to access it directly.MY RATINGMyBook is a great 1 TB USB 2.0 drive. I consider Western Digital to be a trustworthy HARDWARE brand and, so far, I haven't been disappointed. The software... I can do without. In fact, I am much better off without it. Since it does not appear that WD is charging any significant premium for the SmartWare 'feature', I will still rate this as a 2-star, translating in ""I don't like it"", for the time I wasted on recovering from the initial SmartWare installation. My rating would have been higher if SmartWare were an easier to avoid problem - as in not forcing me to seek ways of removing that 'ghost' drive. The drive is getting TWO stars (not one) because, software aside, it IS a good drive and I'm using it.___________________________________Note: March 27, 2011After all these months of flawless and continuous performance (attached to a home server) and given that the SmartWare incident is long forgotten, I feel it's fair to upgrade my star rating to 4 stars because I really 'like' this HDD.","[2, 2]",Good 1TB Drive.

Dent ""Aragorn""",1259452800,5.0,B002LARRDK,"11 29, 2009","The Squeezebox Radio is a first class, excellent Internet radio with clock/alarm functions. With the Flickr app installed, it will display photos stored under user's Flickr account. Other capabilities which are nice to have but not likely to be widely used include its ability to stream audio from a computer or double up as an iPod speaker.PACKAGING, CONTENTSAs it's the case with most Logitech products, the Squeezebox Radio comes inside a box where everything is packed nicely and securely, with enough padding to ensure that rough treatment won't damage it. All shiny surfaces are protected by plastic film sheets. I experienced no problems or frustrations taking components out of the box.The box contents include:- the Radio- power adapter with the US-standard 110V removable plug- 3.5mm audio cord for iPod or other MP3 players- folded poster with setup guide/manual/warranty statementLogitech's warranty is for 2 years from date of purchase and they would expect you to have the purchase receipt and to pay for shipping unless local laws prohibit that.INITIAL SETUPThe physical setup is as easy as attaching the removable plug to the power adapter, plugging the adapter into a power outlet and connecting it to the radio and turning the on the radio. An Ethernet port (cable not included) is available for wired connections. I did not attempt to perform a wired network setup.Once the radio is on for the first time, a language is selected from those displayed on the screen and then the radio will attempt to find a wireless access point. In my case, it immediately found my Linksys router and connected to it.The initial setup completed with me creating a Logitech account by providing an email address and a password. At that point it's possible to listen to the radio.OPERATIONRadio-----Starting with 'radio', the array of options is almost overwhelming. The least intimidating way to get to listen to a station is by selecting 'Internet Radio'. This will open a multi-layered menu with everything from Staff Picks, Local, Music, Sports, Talk, World and Search. If you pick World, the next layer would include Find a City, Featured Cities, National Networks, World Music. Find a City would open a listing of continents. If you pick Antarctica, believe it or not, you can select between All Stations or By Genre. It turns out that the only genre in that continent was Folk and there was actually a Folk station broadcasting off Antarctica. This was just an example to show the breadth and depth of the Internet Radio menu option. Once you like a station, it can be easily assigned to one of the 6 preset buttons that flank the radio's color display.Another way to get music off the Internet is through Apps. These are dowloadable setups that would let your radio channel some services, some of them free. There are 29 such Apps that Logitech allows you to download and use at the time this review was written, not all of them free and not all of them 'music'. Staying with the music, the easiest way you can get an App to work on your radio is from Logitech's site you access with your Logitech account - Logitech promises not to Spam you and so far I didn't get any Spam from them. My favorite FREE music App/service so far is Pandora. It lets me, among other things, create my own 'radio stations' by simply entering one or more artists and songs names. Then, Pandora will play music that is compatible with my input. For example, I entered Pink Floyd, the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix for one of my 'stations' and I get to listen to, besides theses three, the Doors, Led Zeppelin, some Cream.The Settings menu is equally rich in options. It's another multi-layered menu tree that controls just about every aspect of your Squeeze and I'm not going to go into details because it may take several pages. The good news is that the options are pretty well organized and it shouldn't be difficult to customize the aspects of your Squeezebox behavior that you would like to modify. Thankfully, the 'Restore Factory Defaults' option exists, buried somewhere, 3 or 4 levels deep under Advanced.Clock and Alarm---------------By default, the Squeezebox will display the date and time when turned off. There's no need to do anything to set date/time since it seems to 'get' the correct location for the time zone off your IP address. It's possible to select a different zone through the Settings menu, of course.The Alarm function is surprisingly rich. Any number of separate alarms can be set - don't know if there is a limit. You can set the time, whether it's a one-time or reoccurring and if it's a repeat alarm, the day of the week it will play. The volume can be selected and then you can dive into another one of Logitech's overwhelming menu trees that allows you to sound your alarm from the current playlist or play one of many Musical Sounds, Natural Sounds, or Sound Effects. Not much to complain other than you can't hear a sample of the sound you selected or maybe I didn't know how to play it.Other Internet Apps-------------------Normally, the Squeezebox will display the logo of the station you are playing or, if you are listening to a service such as Pandora, you will see the album cover the song came from. But if you install the Flickr App, you can display your Flickr pics instead. It's pretty cool but it wears off quite quickly. The color screen is nice and bright but it's also small and I get a radio because I want to listen to it, not to stare at a 2-inch screen. Again, it's nice but I wouldn't miss this capability if it wasn't available.There are other innovative apps that may have some limited use. The Amazon app for example, will allow you to buy your favorite music directly from the Squeezebox (wow!!!). The Facebook app will, according to the Logitech site, allow you to share your favorite music with family and friends, discover new friends with similar music interests or communicate with friends away from your computer. I didn't try it yet.More Features-------------As if this wasn't enough, the Squeezebox also allows you to stream music off your home computers after you install the Squeezebox Server on it - supports Windows (Vista/XP/2000), Mac, Ubuntu, Linux. Again, a nice thing to have but I simply can't see why I would want to stream music to a device equipped with a small, mono speaker. I'd rather listen to music off my laptop since it comes out in stereo there. I suspect it works well but I didn't think it was worth trying.The Squeezebox also allows to connect and play an iPod or some other MP3 player - cable provided. And, again, it's good to have this but piping iPod music through a little mono speaker... not worth it.Finally, you can listen to the Squeezebox with headphones. It's nice you can but I don't think too many users would care about this capability.MY EXPERIENCEI find the Squeezebox to be an extraordinarily great Internet Radio device. Or rather, an Alarm Clock/Internet Radio. While limited by the small, single speaker to 'mono' sound, the quality of the output is quite impressive. I suspect there's a large cache built in because, when listening to the same Pandora output on my computer and on the Squeeze, the Squeeze came pretty close to crystal-clear while my computer's output was below par.It's impossible to say how many stations can be tuned to but the number should be in the thousands. It's not always easy to find what you are looking for but quick and dirty searches are possible by simply entering the station's call letters or you can go geographically by continent/country/city/genre.Some of the available Apps are fun to use - something like Pandora's customized radio stations should be close to one's dream of music listening. Other apps can go in the 'wow' category as in ""I can't believe they can do this"" but aren't likely to be used much. The beauty of the Apps concept is that the Squeezebox is infinitely expandable as more Apps doing things we can't imagine today can be added when available.What impressed most about the Squeezebox were:- extraordinary easy and quick setup on a Wi-Fi network- the sheer volume of Internet radio stations available- the availability of great Apps such as Pandora- the Alarm/Clock function- the color screen that displays interesting information such as album covers or stations logos and the name of the artists playing- infinite expandability through new AppsSome of the shortcomings include:- ONLY 6 preset station buttons- mono sound- a simple remote control would make operation easier- there's no information in the broadcast quality (kbps) displayed anywhere or rating the station based on the quality of their broadcast- it's possible to get lost into some of the enormous menu trees- completely dependent on Logitech for service - nothing other than maybe streaming music from one's own computer would work if Logitech went out of business or stopped supporting the Squeezebox.MY RATINGI really, really love this device and Amazon's rating for ""I love it"" is 5 stars. Clearly, it's not perfect but, for the price, this is close to the best one can get when it comes to the ability to listen to distant radio stations without involving a computer.All we hear is Radio Ga GaRadio Blah BlahRadio what's new?Someone still loves you!_______________________________________Note:Please see the first comment to this review on the ability to expand the sound quality to 'stereo' and 'amplified'.

I would not get one for a kid because it's easy lose.- Very light, feels almost weightless. The clip let's you attach just about anywhere on your clothing: shirt pocket, collar, lapel. Perfect for jogging or exercising.- Only charges via the USB port (MINI, not MICRO). The included 4-5"" long cable can be used to charge it off a computer but you can use any phone charger that supports USB MINI. We found several around the house from older phones we no longer use.- The computer WILL recognize it when connected over a USB wire but will not see it as a 'letter' disk. You can drag and drop music into it and the internal memory are separated from the memory card but I found it a lot easier to load the Micro SD card while separated from the player.- The rechargeable battery is NOT replaceable. When the battery dies, your player dies.- There is a built-in radio and it can search for stations and save them.- Built-in microphone allows for voice recordings.- Playlists are supported.- The equalizer has a few preset modes and a custom mode where you can set it yourself.- Comes with a pair of cheap but not so bad headphones.- SanDisk would really like you to join their 'ecosystem' - they are pushing so called 'radio cards' that come with pre-recorded music and some subscription service that would give your unlimited music.- There is a one-year limited warranty, probably not worth much.- It does have a clip.- It's easy enough to use, I never felt the need to look up the manual but you do get a manual.- Made in Taiwan.To conclude, I am EXTREMELY happy with this little gadget. It's inexpensive and it does everything I needed. For a few extra dollars, you can turn it into a 10GB player with an 8GB card or an 18GB player if you feel like adding a 16GB. For as long as it's not mishandled or lost, the Sansa will make its owner happy. It's a 5-Star.By the way, the 2GB was the ideal size for me because I don't really plan to use the internal memory.________________________________MY PROJECT:I needed an MP3 player for one specific project: play music randomly off a large playlists in a car that had one AUX port. The player had to be: inexpensive (of course), allow for memory cards that were to store 'his and hers' music, last for over 10 hours on one charge because the cigarette lighter was reserved for the GPS and prove itself reliable.The solution was:- This player - the SanDisk Sansa 2GB.- A couple of inexpensiveHP 8 GB Class 4 microSDHC Flash Memory Card L1885A-EFto store my music and my wife's.- A good qualityInCarCables Car Stereo Ipod/mp3 Auxiliary Aux-in Input Cable 3.5mm (4ft)to connect to the car's receiver.It worked well.

A Webcam is a Webcam some may say and they may be largely correct but, as some of us know, little details often make the difference between a good product and a great product and I consider the LifeCam to be one of the great products in its class, especially at the current price level.PACKAGING AND INSTALLATIONIt's not so easy to get the cam out of the fancy box - be careful or you could end up with a few cuts from sharp plastic sheets - but, once out of the box, the installation is quick and easy. You run the CD - and you are warned NOT to plug the camera in until prompted to do so - you plug the camera into a USB port and... that's it. Microsoft recommends that you also install Windows Live but... thank you very much I can live without it. By not installing it I won't be able to begin a video call by tapping the little button on the top of the camera and that's okay with me.Physically, the camera sits safely on top of my monitor, the rubbery grip kind of bonded with it without me having to do much - inspired, efficient design.FEATURES AND OPERATION (see posted image)- Resolution can be anything from 160x120 to 1080x720 and a few more in-between.- Up to 424x240 you get 30 frames per second. Any higher resolution outputs only 15 frames per second. It's possible that the video card dictates the frame rate. I tested with an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3400 Series with 996 MB Total available graphics memory.- Advanced video controls let you tweak brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, white balance, and set for backlight compensation if needed. If you happen to be in Europe, you can set the 'powerline frequency to 50 Hz to reduce flicker' - and I noticed no flicker myself.- You can also control the camera's zoom, focus, exposure, aperture, pan, tilt and roll and set the low light compensation on if needed - all of the above done through soft controls, no need to actually touch the camera.- It's also possible to 'move' the camera up/down and left/right and zoom in/out but these are limited adjustments and they do not work at the higher resolutions.- The cam's window also comes with 3 useful buttons that would, when pushed, snap a picture, stard audio capture and start a video capture session.- Finally, just for fun, you are provided with exactly 42 ways of having fun with your picture by either grossly distorting it, playing with the color mix or applying various objects on your face that the software tries to keep them following your moves: glasses, masks, wigs, hats and other such disguises.MY EVALUATION - 5 starsThere is really nothing to complain about this little device. Everything it does and the way it does it are close to superlative. I found the LifeCam to work with nearly all apps that will take advantage of a 'Web cam', be easy to setup and use, provide a steady, high quality image even in less than ideal conditions, allow for flexibility and even for fun.If you need a cam to sit on top of your monitor, can't go wrong with this one.","[2, 2]","For a Web cam, it can't get much better than this",2010,02, 8,1.0,3209,578,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20100208

Same should hold true for the upcoming PS3's 250GB model. The minor price difference between purchasing a 250GB Slim vs. upgrading an existing 120GB PS3 to 500GB or 640GB should make such an upgrade attractive to anyone who feels that 200-400GB of extra storage are needed.At the time of this review, the 640GB does not offer the lowest cost per GB - that honor belongs to the 500GB model. I have little doubt that this is bound to change.POSSIBLE USES- Upgrade an existing laptop drive. I have upgraded mine from 60GB to a WD 500GB 2.5"" SATA recently and I've been happy ever since.- Upgrade a PS3. I have upgraded my PS3 from 60GB to a WD 320GB more than a year ago and I no longer worry about disk storage limitation. I helped a co-worker upgrade her brand-new 120GB Slim to THIS model about a week ago and it was quick, easy and uneventful - it helps starting with a brand-new PS3 to avoid backup/restore complications.- Turn it into an external storage drive. It CAN be done by casing it inside an external enclosure and attach it to a computer and having it powered via an USB cable but why bother? Many vendors offer similar capacity external drives at better prices.It should be noted that there is a bonus involved when upgrading a laptop or a PS3 to a larger HDD - the old drive. I do buy enclosures for those and I tend to use them as backup devices - redundant storage for photos, documents and so on.MY RATINGI give this HDD its 5 stars for being the largest in it's class 2.5"", 9.5mm form factor and for my happy history with WD drives - not one has failed me yet. WD and others do make larger, 1TB 2.5"" SATA drives but those come in 12.5mm and will NOT fit inside a PS3 or most existing laptops.____________________________________Note:For anyone new to this who considers upgrading a PS3 (easy) or a laptop (much harder because it involves possibly backup/restore and re-registering the OS with Microsoft), please note that the HDD does NOT look as intimidating as the picture shows. For some reasons, the marketing people decide to almost always show the 'naked' disk - which is the HDD with the enclosure removed. In reality, what you see in this picture is enclosed inside an air-tight, sealed, aluminum capsule and the only things you will be physically interacting are a couple of connectors and a few small screws.","[53, 57]","Largest upgrade option for any PS3 and laptops that need 2.5""/9.5mm-height SATA HDDs",2009,10, 18,0.9298245614035088,2658,467,Positive,53,57,4,0.024002605438853606,20091018

It's a highly standardized format because all SATA drives are meant to fit inside standard laptop drive bays and it's impossible to make it any smaller. To state that the CLON is one of the smallest 2.5"" drives is not very meaningful. 2.5"" is... 2.5"", always. After placing the CLON next to theStarTech SAT2510U2 InfoSafe 2.5-Inch USB/SATA Hard Drive Enclosure, it turns out that the CLON has the exact same width and thickness but, indeed, it is 1/8"" shorter than the InfoSafe and the InfoSafe does not claim to be 'one of the smallest'.Portability-----------All 2.5"" external SATA drives are nearly equally portable. It would have been nice if the CLON came with some (cushioned) carrying box that would also hold the USB wire but it doesn't. The CLON is only a bare-bones drive in a black enclosure.Design------The drive's enclosure closely follows the disk's flat shape, nothing notable unless the fact that it is 'black' can get someone excited. The plastic is mostly matte, not shiny so, unless you touch the part of the enclosure that is shiny, fingerprints won't be visible.A design or maybe an engineering issue is the plastic body. The CLON tends to run pretty hot because plastic is not so good at dissipating heat. Disks encased in an aluminum casing can stay much cooler but they are a little heavier too. If all you need the CLON is for the occasional 'peace of mind' backup, this shouldn't be a big deal. My unit, while getting alarmingly hot, did not melt during my test 4.5 hours backup job.Storage-------320GB is a good chunk of space for backups but 'state of the art' for a 2.5""/9.5mm SATA at the time I write this review is 640GB. 1TB 2.5"" SATA drives are available in the more exotic 12.5mm form factor.Versatility-----------Like all external HDDs in its class, the CLON is powered by the host laptop/desktop via the USB wire. Unlike some, powering it through a separate power adaptor is not an option.The CLON comes formatted as NTFS. This is the native file system for Windows XP and Vista but, as far as I know, Macs are not very comfortable with it. Mac compatibility is claimed and I have no reason to doubt that this is indeed the case.Backup capabilities-------------------I was not impressed by the bundled Nero BackItUp 4. It took it over 4 hours to back up 80GB and, to make it worse, it doesn't have a way of backing up a Windows system partition (the C: drive in most cases). I posted to screenshots providing some supporting evidence to the statements I made above. I uninstalled Nero because I have no use for it.Performance-----------Almost 4.5 hours to backup 80GB (with verify) is just terrible. I am blaming the backup software for this sluggishness but I found no compelling evidence that would place the CLON drive among the top performers in its class.Value-----A 320GB OEM drive, a 2.5"" SATA enclosure and a 1-foot long USB wire can be had for less than the CLON sells and the end-result would be something almost indistinguishable from Verbatim's product - I put together 2 of these myself out of older discarded laptop and PS3 drives. CLON's price is not at all attractive. A drive enclosure can be had for less than $5 and it usually comes with the needed USB cable. An equivalent, good quality 2.5"", 360GB, 5400RPM SATA drive can be had for about $60 at the time I write this. You add up the 2 and, it turns out that there isn't a lot of value in the CLON. Even for those who don't feel comfortable with assembling a CLON-like portable drive from scratch, competitors offer drives of similar physical size with larger storage (500GB) and some backup utility at a lower price.Note:Since I wrote this review, the price of this unit dropped by 30%. This is a very sensible thing to do because only a completely uninformed customer would have bought it at the 'list' price, only to regret it. This brings the 'value' closer if not on par with what other vendors charge for equivalent products but I still maintain the the CLON is a 'nondescript' product that offers nothing above and beyond the competition does.EVALUATIONI found nothing that would compel me to 'like' the CLON and pick IT over whatever the competition offers and therefore grant it 4 stars. At the same time, the slow backup software aside, there is little really 'bad' about it. CLON is a mediocre product that barely earns its 3-stars which the Amazon star translators decode as ""it's OK"".Since the backup software was CLON's worst feature, I uninstalled it as soon as my little benchmark backup completed. And, since I just happen to have a 320GB HDD on my PS3, I formatted the CLON for FAT32 (used FAT32FORMAT) and I am using it now to back up my PS3 - backing up the about 120GB of PS3 content completed in less than one third of the time it took NERO's BackItUp to finish my laptop's 80GB C: partition.","[0, 0]",Nondescript,2009,10, 26,,5209,905,Neutral,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20091026

All you get for instructions is an 8x8"" ""quickstart"" card, graphically detailing the 4 steps needed to get the Mini up and running with the iPod of your choice and what you need to do to make it work with your computer. Their confidence was justified. I had no trouble whatsoever and the 8x8"" card was all that I needed.I find the Mini to be a worthy, beautifully designed, well built, good quality sound, semi-portable iPod speaker system AND a spectacular amplified computer speaker. In either configuration, the Mini met my expectations and, in a couple of instances, it managed to actually surprise me with unexpected features and versatility.CONTENTS, etc.Off the box, you get the following:- The Mini's body, showing the iPod dock in the front and the POWER, AUX and USB-B ports in the back.- 4 dock adapters for the iPods that can't connect directly to the dock.- An oval-shaped, small remote control with POWER, +, -, SKIP AHEAD, SKIP BACK and PLAY/PAUSE buttons.- The AC adapter and its cable- The Quickstart card- A power cable to connect the AC adapter to the power source.- A folded sheet with safety and warranty information in about 50 languages.Conspicuously missing is a USB-A/USB-B cable required to connect the Mini to a computer. On a product THIS expensive I expected to see the cable included because this is a rather rare type of USB configuration and it's usually supplied by the manufacturer with their product. Amazon sells one as .... and it is supplied by many other vendors.The English version of the warranty statement promises that the Mini will work for at least  2-years and it will be fixed if it doesn't unless... you drop it, it gets struck by lighting, you use it in some unusual ways, you abuse it, you allow someone else to try to fix it or you drop your sales receipt showing the date of purchase - so make sure you keep that. There's an 800 number you can dial in the US for warranty support.SETUP AND OPERATIONThe initial setup involves removing the plastic strip that prevents the remote's battery from draining while the product is being shipped and plugging the Mini into a power outlet. Once the iPod is connected to the dock, you can use the remote to play whatever you happen to have stored there, including movies. The dock's arm will rotate 90 degrees either to the right or left to allow for video watching.The following iPods will plug directly into the dock: Classic, Nano 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation. With the supplied adapters you can attach the iPod Touch 1st and 2nd generations as well as the iPhone, iPhone 3G and 3GS.Equally important is the Mini's ability to interface with a computer. When attached via the (not supplied) USB-A/USB-B cable, to my surprise and delight, the remote had the ability to PLAY/STOP and SKIP AHEAD/BACK, effectively controlling the Windows Media Player.MY EVALUATIONI was impressed by the Mini's design, ease of setup and operation, its ability to support many iPod and iPhone devices and its ability to effectively act as the best computer speaker that I've owned so far.While small in size, the Mini Zeppelin is heavy enough to stick to the desk's surface and avoid creating any unwanted vibrations. The sound is loud, clear and well balanced even though, my untrained ear is telling me that a little bit more bass would have helped. In most instances, taking advantage of your player's equalizer capabilities would get a sound nothing short of spectacular out such a small speaker package. The ability to control the Windows Media Player via the remote is a big plus for me because I expect to use the Mini as a computer speaker for at least 75% of the time.A major positive is the Mini's ability to easily interface with a computer over the USB connection. Let's face it, a speaker set this good and this expensive just MIGHT outlast the current generation of iPods and it would be a shame if our investment's fate was completely tied to that of the an iPod which probably cost a fraction of what you paid for the Mini.There is always room for improvement and a somewhat more authoritative bass range would bring the Mini closer to small speaker perfection. This may not be so easy to accomplish. However, throwing a USB cable into the box (they're cheap) should be easy and I do hope that Mr. Bowers and Wilkins, if they read this review, will consider doing so. Customers will love them more for it.In the end, the shortcomings I mentioned are massively outweighed by the Mini's features, design and quality. I do love this product and Amazon's star rating for 'I love it' is 5 stars so that's what it gets.","[6, 7]",A serious candidate for the 'best in class' award,2009,12, 27,0.8571428571428571,4734,821,Positive,6,7,1,0.02256961406936981,20091227

I thought I'd better start with a little FAQ on the device. These are questions that I was asked by friends and coworkers who saw me playing with the Flip and questions that I wished I had answers for if I was about to make a buy decision.__________________________________________________Q - If it stops working, which is not a rare occurrence, is it easy to get a warranty replacement?A - No, but I did get one after hours of online chatting with help support and escalating emails and phone calls.Q - Who makes the Flip?A - The Flip is made by Pure Digital Technologies which was acquired by Cisco sometime in 2009.Q - What do you get in the box?A - The Flip's body, a wrist strap, a micro fiber pouch and a Quick Start guide.Q - Is there any warranty?A -  The Cisco-backed warranty covers the product for 90 (ninety) days against defects in material and workmanship under 'normal' use.Q - How large/portable is it?A - The light body is 4"" long, 2"" wide and 1/2"" thick. The display on the back is 2"" on the diagonal.Q - How easy/hard is it to operate?A - The Flip is very easy to operate. All you have is a power button on the side, a large, red start/stop (recording) push button on the back, up/down(zoom in/out), left/right, start playback and trash(delete) touch buttons.Q - How much video can be stored on the Flip?A - The 8GB internal storage holds up to 2 hours of video.Q - What is the resolution?A - I haven't seen it documented anywhere but it appears to be 1152 by 720.Q - Is there a way to control/change the image resolution?A - No. There is one fixed resolution and it can't be changed.Q - What file format is the Flip using?A - .MP4Q - Can the battery be replaced? How long does it last?A - The rechargeable battery can't be replaced. It should last from 30 to 45 minutes on a full charge.Q - How long it takes to charge the battery?A - About 3-4 hours to fully charge an empty battery by plugging the Flip into you computer's USB port.Q - Is a charger included?A - No. The Flip is charged by inserting its 'flippable' USB arm into a computer USB port. A charger can be purchased separately at Flip's Web site. [UPDATE: I should have checked before I ordered it, Amazon has it too -Flip Video Power Adapter- for less but beware, the adapter itself comes without a charging cord so that would be yet another purchase.Q - Is the recorded video true HD?A - Yes. The output comes out as true HD resolution (see above) the colors are rich and vibrant and the image is sharp.Q - How good are the videos?A - On good light, the image is sharp and the sound is good too (regardless of light conditions). The Flip is pretty good at auto-focusing but it has no 'shake protection' whatsoever so if you are moving while shooting the output will suffer.Q - How easy is it to record/operate?A - You turn on the Flip and when what you wish to record appears in the 2"" display, you push the red 'record' button. The up/down touch buttons allow you to zoom in/out. When you're done, you push the red button again.Q - Where are your videos stored?A - Once you plug the Flip into a computer's USB port, it will install its software on the computer and it will allow you to transfer your videos to the computer and optionally remove them from Flip's memory.Q - What else can you do with Flip's software?A - You can make 'movies' by joining video files and adding a title and credits, you can make video greeting cards, you can post your videos to YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, you can burn them on a DVD and you can play them back.Q - Is the Flip expandable or can it be customized in any way?A - No. The amount of storage is fixed, there are no memory card slots and the battery can't be replaced.Q - Can the Flip play videos directly on a TV?A - Yes. The Flip has a mini-HDMI port that can be used to connect it to a TV. A special HDMI cable (with a mini port) is needed to make this possible.Q - What else would you need to make great videos?A - The most helpful accessory would be a (mini)tripod. The Flip has a tripod mount and the best videos I was able to make were with the Flip mounted on one. I am usingQ:electronics Flexible Tripod (Charcoal Black)but Flip sell their own.__________________________________________________I don't expect to have asked/answered all the important question above but I would encourage anyone who may consider going for the Flip to post any questions as a comment to this review and I will be happy to answer them and add them to the FAQ.Now, my subjective judgement on the Flip follows.THINGS THAT I LIKE- small, very portable- excellent video resolution and overall picture quality for the price- extreme ease of use- the tripod mount- great sound quality for a gadget this small- the included wrist strap and velvety pouch- holds and installs own software when plugged into a computer- easy to publish videos on YouTube/FacebookTHINGS THAT I DO NOT LIKE- unless you buy some 'extras', must have a computer handy to charge it (weird)- can't replace the battery- no memory card slots- short battery life- awkward charging- short (90 day) warrantyMy overall - and subjective impression - leans toward 'so-so' but more like 'less-so'.It's possible to produce some good quality output with a tripod and some third-party video editing software but the quality suffers when the camera is handheld.I liked the ease with which the Flip interfaced with my computer but I did not appreciate the need to keep it hanging off an USB port for hours to charge. The Flip's lack of expandability and the knowledge that, once the battery dies so does the Flip is a real concern, especially when coupled with the relative short battery life on a full charge because it will not get better overtime. The (only) 90-day warranty may be an indication that the makers themselves aren't very confident that their product was built to last very long.In the end, weighing Flip's ability to produce good video with minimum effort against the 'negatives' should yield a rating that's 'in between' ""I almost like it"" that's more like a 2.5 stars is my score.________________________________Note:I found that theUSB Travel Charger for SanDisk Sansa Clip/ Sansa Fuze/Sansa View/Sansa e200is perfect at charging my MinoHD and almost a steal, pricewise. You will need a cord, unless you want your MinoHD hanging off its USB charging arm while charging.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[1, 1]","Flip FAQ - ease of operation, quality output, quite a few issues",2010,04, 25,1.0,6832,1215,Negative,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20100425

Dent ""Aragorn""",1274832000,3.0,B002SGATH8,"05 26, 2010","I ordered the Cooler Master Notepal U2 (nice name) for my kid's 14.1"" VAIO laptop - after 2+ years or near continuous use (and some abuse) the internal fan gave up and the laptop would turn itself off when overheating. I decided to order it based on the near unanimous good reviews and on the low price. Sadly, I did not pay attention to a little detail that should be obvious by just looking at Amazon's product picture - the fans are powered through the computer's own USB port. For the good news, the laptop does not overheat as much. The bad news is that it still turns itself off due to eventual overheating, after about 2 hours of use rather than after 10 minutes. In addition, the sloped, slippery surface causes the laptop to slide down off the cooler almost every time the keyboard is touched, like when typing something, which makes it more likely that the fans are no longer positioned underneath the 'hot spots' they were supposed to keep cool.FEATURES/DESIGNThe Notepal U2 consists of a aluminum 'mesh' sloped base with a couple of rubbery accents and two USB-powered little fans underneath. The 'genius' part of the design is giving you the ability to position the fans anywhere underneath your base, hopefully exactly underneath your laptop's 'hot spots' for more efficient cooling. The USB connector has a 'pass through' USB extension that should allow you to plug some other device that does not require power - an external HDD won't work but you may be able to use it for a USB thumb drive.Alternately, the makers suggest that you can sort of bullet-proof your laptop if your remove the fans and slide your laptop underneath the aluminum mesh, where the fans used to be. An elastic belt is provided to keep your laptop secured. Then, you should be able to carry your better protected laptop in your regular bag. I am somewhat intrigued by this capability because I'm not sure in what way you will be better off if you have the aluminum shield protect one side of your laptop and I'm wondering what would happen delay-wise if I showed up with such an 'armored' laptop at an airport.ME EVALUATIONLike I said, the cooler actually did cool the bottom of my kid's laptop somewhat and at least postponed for us the greater expense of having its internal fan professionally replaced or buying a new laptop. The fans are easy to place anywhere under the laptop and that makes this cooler more efficient. This is everything positive I can say about this product.On the 'bad' category, I find the base slope to be too steep and there's nothing you can do about it. Anyone used to a 'flat' keyboard may find this intolerable. In addition, my kid's VAIO's smooth bottom sitting on the sloped aluminum platform causes it to move down and off the base whenever the laptop is touched. This may be something that only affects certain laptops with sleek bottoms, I'm not so sure. Depending on where on the desk the cooler is placed, your laptop may actually fall on the floor if you are not careful.As I already noted, powering TWO fans through the laptop's USB port is NOT a good idea. You can only draw a very tiny amount of power through that port and, therefore, you can't really provide a lot of air circulation. Since this a heavy cooler - about 2 lbs. heavy - the reasonable expectation should be that it sits on  a desktop and it does not travel with the laptop. Therefore, it makes very little sense to power it via USB rather than use a power outlet and ensure that some serious cooling takes place. In the case of my son's laptop, the tiny whiff of air produced did not do the job.I am also skeptical that larger laptops (up to 17"") would sit comfortably on the U2. Its size seems perfect for a 14"" but I don't see a lot of room to spare for a larger laptop.In conclusion, this would have been a perfect cooler if the base slope was less steep and less slippery and if the fans were properly powered. While it's possible that it might help some, I can't recommend it and I feel that buying it was a mistake._____________________________Note on the vendor: while I may have issues with the product, my experience with this 'Amazon associate' vendor was first class. LLYTECH shipped the item quickly and I received an email notification that had the tracking number. I did not attempt to return the product because, until we decided what to do next, my son wanted to keep it so I don't know how they would handle a 'return' transaction.","[0, 0]","Slippery slope, not so cool",2010,05, 26,,4446,795,Neutral,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20100526

The 3-pack should provide the same quality and service. Just to clear any doubt, this cable works as well as any other 6 ft. HDMI wire (probably because they are all made in the same factory overseas), including the premium ones and it's probably not better than those that sell at Amazon for one penny (plus S&H;, coming down to just about the same price). Also, it's no worse than the so-called 'premium' brands that rarely offer much more than a brand name and maybe a pretty-looking connector in addition to what the cheap cables do.In fairness, the 'ULTRAFAST' designation means NOTHING other than a nice marketing word so don't buy this cable because it's supposed to be 'ultrafast' because it isn't any faster than any other cable. If you look at the HDMI 1.3 specs I posted at the bottom of this review, the 10.2Gbps follows the EXACT HDMI specs all cables are EXPECTED to support:- Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s) 10.2When it comes to decide which brand to order I always go with the 'cheap' ones because, to the extent that they comply with the HDMI specs, you don't get better service from the more expensive brands. And the ironic thing is that the more expensive and sophisticated the hardware that the HDMI cable connects, the less you are going to need a so-called 'high quality' cable because the more advanced receivers have the ability to correctly interpret the weak or ambiguous signals that the cheaper or less advanced hardware may have trouble with. In any case, the HDMI consortium is confident that at this short length most HDMI cables will perform well.Since these cables are sold by Amazon, anyone who may be concerned about possible issues should keep in mind that they can take advantage of Amazon's easy return policy. If you are returning the item because it came defective or damaged Amazon pays for shipping it back and offers a full refund or a replacement. You can also return anything for any reason for as long as the item was not damaged and you pay for shipping it back.I would definitely go with the 3-pack if I needed more than one cable.________________________________________Here are the HDMI 1.3 specs supported by this cable the premium brands and the less expensive alternatives:Maximum signal bandwidth (MHz) 340Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s) 10.2Maximum video bandwidth (Gbit/s) 8.16Maximum audio bandwidth (Mbit/s) 36.86Maximum Color Depth (bit/px) 48Maximum resolution over single link at 24-bit/px 25601600p75Maximum resolution over single link at 30-bit/px 25601600p60Maximum resolution over single link at 36-bit/px 1920x1200p75Maximum resolution over single link at 48-bit/px 19201200p60sRGBYCbCr8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio capabilityBlu-ray Disc video and audio at full resolutionConsumer Electronic Control (CEC)DVD-Audio supportSuper Audio CD (DSD) supportDeep ColorxvYCCAuto lip-syncDolby TrueHD bitstream capableDTS-HD Master Audio bitstream capableUpdated list of CEC commands (only on HDMI 1.3a,b,c)","[47, 47]",The way to go if you need more than one cable,2010,02, 10,1.0,3109,496,Positive,47,47,0,0.023937469467513434,20100210

'Class 10' guarantees transfer speeds of at least 80 Mbit/s - or 10 Megabytes per second - which is about 66x in CD-ROM speed rating equivalent. This is not the highest class rating for SD cards but it's fast enough for most digital camcorders. In fact, most (like mine) are quite happy with the lower speed 'Class 6'. On a mostly still frame camera that accepts SDHC this should be a speed monster.It's worth noting that the card came formatted as FAT32. This is what most cameras would like to see but some Microsoft operating systems may not allow you to reformat and some older cameras may not be able to recognize anything over 4GB. My Windows 7 laptop could read the card through an included USB adapter. As for formatting it, there are public domain formatting utilities out there that would allow you to do it under XP, Vista or Windows 7 if your camera has trouble reformatting it.PACKAGING, CONTENTS AND WARRANTYIt was not easy to take the card and the adapter out of the near-bullet-proof plastic enclosure but a pair of powerful scissors did the job, eventually but not without cutting some of the included paperwork.Besides the card, there is a very generic, credit-card size 'manual' that comes with the usual warnings - don't touch the connectors, don't bend the card and so on.The lifetime warranty statement on the card (whose lifetime?) will have Transcend replace or repair your item if you still have your receipt and you don't do anything from a long list of activities and nothing  that's on a long list of possible happenings happens to the card (don't chew on it). In other words, it's meaningless.Finally, there's a card inside the package that promises 'free software' in the form of a 'photo recovery' tool from Transcend's site. It would install on the card itself if you go to the site with the card plugged in and have it download directly into the card. If it installs successfully, you should be able to recover some deleted photos and even photos lost because the card was formatted by mistake. I chose not to download the tool because I'd have no use for it but it's good that it's there.MY RATINGI like this card for its price, the card's relatively large capacity (32GB are also available) and for its speed. I do not appreciate the largely meaningless 'lifetime warranty' claims used to market the product but I don't care much about warranties on items for which the cost of shipping them to the vendor may come close or exceed the cost of buying a new one.Since the product does very much what I expect it to do, a 4-star rating - means ""I like it"" - is fair.","[0, 0]","Fast, reliable, large capacity, good value overall",2011,02, 3,,3327,595,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20110203

If you have an old computer still struggling with the super-slow 802.11a Wi-Fi protocol I can't think of a better investment than this little, inexpensive adapter.______________________________________Before I continue, it's probably worth sharing my experience vs. a couple of claims I noted in other reviews:- I get 4-5 bars and 150 Mbps from the second floor from an n-router located in the basement. If you get poor signal, I'd look at the router first before blaming the adapter. Sometimes moving the router a few feet can be the difference.- I don't believe this is 'plug and play'. On my old XP computer I had to run the setup. It's an executable found in the 'Windows' folder which can be found inside a folder that has RT3070 as part of its name.- Do NOT plug in the adapter before you run the Setup. The instructions state that you must run the Setup first and only AFTER the Setup completes you plug in the adapter. I followed the instructions and, 3 minutes later I had a perfectly working adapter.- The mini-CD seems to have setup executables for many operating systems but the little pamphlet that comes with the adapter only claims Windows compatibility.______________________________________I decided to splurge and spend a few dollars (Amazon free shipping when I ordered it) because of one, old Windows XP minitower in our house whose 802.11a Wi-Fi that couldn't go any faster than 11 Mbps was slowing down everything else connected to our new, super-fast, dual band 802.11n router. I didn't know whether it was going to work (very old machine) so I picked this one because of the price - not much to lose if it didn't work - and because of the other great reviews.I went straight to the RT3070 folder because a sticker on the mini-disc's wrapper had 'Install path:RT3070' printed on it and shared the executable found in the Windows folder. Had to do that because the old computer's CD drive doesn't work any longer. To make the story short, the installation lasted about 2 minutes. I suggest to pick 'install driver only' when prompted. Then... inserted the adapter into an USB port and... the wireless network was immediately detected. As soon as I entered the security key we were zipping at 150 Mbps which is about FIFTEEN TIMES faster than before.To end the story I'd like to say this: I simply can't think of a reason for spending more if all you need is an 802.11n adapter for a Windows computer.

NOTE: I bought mine 'refurbished' for half the price.As a player, this is an inexpensive, basic, no frills unit that does the job I expected it to do and not a lot more - play Blu-ray, DVDs and audio CDs in the bedroom. Nothing more than simple playback should be expected from it but, so far, it has played everything without a glitch. The picture is steady and crisp and so is the audio. There was no skipping so far and old DVDs that became unplayable on the DVD player that it's replacing can be watched again and play flawlessly.First, for what the player lacks: Internet access. There is no Ethernet port and there is no WiFi - therefore there will never be Netflix or Pandora streaming or anything that needs a network connection. In addition there is no easy way to upgrade it or, if it's upgradeable, the capability is not documented in the manual.On the positive side, besides the basic playback, this model does a pretty good job upscaling DVDs and has an SD slot - it supports SD, (miniSD and microSD will need an adapter) and SDHC and it does NOT support miniSDHC or microSDHC cards. You should be able to display JPEG pictures.Available ports include HDMI Out, Audio Out, Component Video Out, Digital Out (coax) and Video Out.The player came with a small and easy to use remote control (batteries included), a 50-page manual and an RCA component video cable.I have no complaints about this model. It is, by design, an inexpensive, basic features Blu-ray player. Up until now, it performed as expected.____________________________________________________IF you are decide to go with the 'refurbished' version, still available at Amazon at the time I'm writing this you may wish to know that:The unit that I got was dirty. This is not an exaggeration. It had greasy, visible fingerprints and palm prints all over it and I had to work a little cleaning it up. It was also scratched. The scratches were minor but it was scratched nevertheless. The refurbish unit's manual is a stapled Xerox copy of the original but it's readable. I understand that 'refurbished' is a rather fuzzy concept but I've been spoiled by the 'like new', quality of refurbished items I received from Linksys or Logitech. This unit arrived in a far from 'like new' condition.Related to the not exactly 'like new' quality of this refurbished product, it's worth noting that the original 1 year Maganvox warranty does not apply. Instead, you get a 90-days warranty that ""does not apply to the cosmetic appearance"" (a quote). In addition, the buyer is expected to pay for shipping.____________________________________________________I don't know if I should consider myself lucky for receiving a working unit but I can only review the product that I received which, once cleaned and hooked up to the TV worked well. The lack of high-end features is not a disappointment or a surprise and it's compensated by the low price. The apparent lack of support is a concern but, again, this is not an expensive product. The 3 stars are well deserved for what I got but I would not recommend this as a 'buy' unless you get it as a 'second' player for the bedroom or maybe the kids' room.5 months since my purchase, it performed flawlessly so far.

This is my first WD Caviar but, after a couple of Scorpio Blues used in my laptops and PS3 and aWD Elements Desktop WDE1UBK10000 - Hard drive - 1 TB - external - 3.5"" - Hi-Speed USB - blackI've learned to rely and trust WD's hardware - haven't had one issue yet as far as installation or performance are concerned and I am confident that this will continue to be the case - will update my review if it's not.As an additional drive, the installation went smoothly and I haven't encountered any problems on a Windows 7 (64 bit) machine. As expected, thanks to the large 64 MB cache, I/O is quick. WD claims that some shock protection features will ensure that you won't be losing your data if you kick or maybe drop your computer - haven't actually tried that. WD also provides a 5 year limited warranty - it doesn't cover your data though.Since I've only used this to store data files, I can't say much about how this would perform as a primary drive or on transferring your OS to it.SPECSI'm not going to go into a lot of detail here - go to WD's site for this.

Can't get much better than this.Given the 1 yr. warranty promise and the ability to easily return the wire to Amazon if you get a defective item, I see no 'negatives'.[Anyone remembers the old ""I am not going to spend a lot for this muffler"" commercial?]The 3-6 ft. are the optimum lengths to connect most electronics. I am actually using 3 ft. cables whenever the connected devices happen to be very close to each other because, when it comes to cables, shorter is almost always better :).Just in case someone may feel guilty for not paying a lot more for a premium brand, it should be stated that at these lengths - 3-6 ft., you will get as good a service from a no-brand cable as you would from a super-expensive rip-off. An HDMI 1.3x cable should be able to carry, error free, all the signal your electronic equipment may put out. In fact, you can buy one or 2 extra 'cheap' cables, just in case. At these prices they're easily affordable.The FUD campaigns, trying to attract buyers toward the more expensive brands make a series of claims. I will address them, as they may apply to this specific cable.- Signal attenuation is less over a more expensive cable. - TRUE, BUT that's irrelevant on a 3-6 ft. length. The HDMI consortium stated that even the cables that were not 'certified' as 'Category 2' or 'High-Speed' will meet the requirements at lengths of 6 ft. or less.  At 3-6 ft., it would be a waste to consider an 'expensive' alternative. In addition, the newer devices have sufficient processing power and are sensitive enough to properly interpret even the more ambiguous 'digits' they receive. Incidentally, the vendor claims that this specific item WAS certified as 'category 2' and HDMI 1.3a.- The expensive cables are better engineered and their contacts are less likely to break. - TRUE, BUT how many times is one going to plug/unplug an HDMI cable in and out of an HDMI socket over the cable's lifetime? 5 times? 10 times? The 'better engineered' claim has no practical importance. If your cable works on 'day one' the odds are that it will be left in the back of your box for many months or years before it is unplugged and plugged back in. If this cable is purchased for home use, the 'better engineered' claim should not be of a major concern.- The more expensive cables are 'future proof'. - NOT TRUE. Claims are made that, if you buy the more expensive wires you won't have to buy new ones when 'new standards' emerge because the more expensive wire will support them. This is untrue on 2 different levels. First, your cheap cable was purchased to work with some very specific devices which need HDMI 1.3 and will never support the 'new standard'. The new standards will be supported by new electronic devices but, for as long as you keep the existing ones, you will still need this cable to connect them. Second, the emerging HDMI 1.4 specs call for new features such as an Ethernet channel and an audio return channel, both of which can't be supported by the existing HDMI 1.3 cables so, no matter how large a bandwidth the existing expensive cables may support, it won't matter because you still won't able to use them if you are to take full advantage of an HDMI 1.4 device so... there goes your $5 invesment or... your $200, depending on your having purchased a 'cheap' or a 'top of the line' HDMI cable.________________________________________Here are the HDMI 1.3 specs supported by both this cable and its more expensive alternatives.Maximum signal bandwidth (MHz) 340Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s) 10.2Maximum video bandwidth (Gbit/s) 8.16Maximum audio bandwidth (Mbit/s) 36.86Maximum Color Depth (bit/px) 48Maximum resolution over single link at 24-bit/px  25601600p75Maximum resolution over single link at 30-bit/px  25601600p60Maximum resolution over single link at 36-bit/px  1920x1200p75Maximum resolution over single link at 48-bit/px  19201200p60sRGBYCbCr8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio capabilityBlu-ray Disc video and audio at full resolutionConsumer Electronic Control (CEC)DVD-Audio supportSuper Audio CD (DSD) supportDeep ColorxvYCCAuto lip-syncDolby TrueHD bitstream capableDTS-HD Master Audio bitstream capableUpdated list of CEC commands (only on HDMI 1.3a,b,c)________________________________________My personal experience: I've never paid 'a lot' for an HDMI cable because it makes no sense to pay more.

As for the portable part, it all depends on what your definition of 'portable' is.I will begin with the 'bad' because it's a major irritant. The quality of this TomTom's display is so bad, I prefer theGarmin StreetPilot c330 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator, my first GPS we bought back in 2006. The 4.3-inch display features low resolution comparable to my ancient Garmin's and what seems to be a graphics engine capable of displaying only a few colors. The 3-D map mode is plagued by color bands. The low resolution drastically limits the level of detail and the amount of information that can be displayed on the screen at any given time. As I noted before, the 3-D map mode which is my favorite on my other GPS units - the old Garmin and aSony NVU83T 4.8-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator- is so bad, I will never use it with the TomTom.And it's a shame because the XL is a neat GPS in so many ways. Here are what I consider to be this unit's good features:- Better navigation engine. Of my 3 GPS units, TomTom's appears to be the better one. So far, TomTom was able to almost always find the best (quickest or shortest) route, but three were exceptions. Whenever I strayed off the recommended track, TomTom quickly adapted to the new reality and recalculated a new route rather than repeatedly trying to steer me back to the old one as my other GPS units usually do.- Free maps, of course. Nothing beats 'free' and update can be easily obtained at TomTom's site by simply connecting the unit to a computer via a supplied proprietary cable that plugs into computer's USB port.- Free traffic. And it's not the 'usual' 3-month free trial. This 'traffic' is truly free. No registration is required. For as long as the unit is plugged into the car's charger the special connecting cable has a built-in FM receiver that grabs traffic information and should alert you of any delays. In practice, 'traffic' is more of a gimmick at this time and TomTom is right to give up attempts to charge for it. I found myself stuck in a traffic jams on MAJOR US highway while TomTom reported 'all-clear' and there were instances when TomTom, based on the traffic information it got off the air, kept telling me that I was in a terrible traffic situation while I was zipping through at 70 mph. Come to think of it, I can't remember ONE instance when the Tom alerted me of a traffic problem and there was indeed a traffic problem ahead. Or the other way around. So, 'traffic' is free but it's useless.- The ability to use ZIP codes for US destinations. It's possible that other GPS brands do ZIP codes but my old Garmin and the newer Sony don't and that was always a big frustration for me.Of course, there are many other features that we now expect in a GPS. They are well implemented and some worth mentioning include:- Touch screen.- Navigate to 'points of interest' including unexpected ones such as 'the nearest dentist' or physician.- Displays time and expected arrival time.- Lane assist graphically shows on which lane you should be before taking a turn or an exit.- 2D/3D maps - like I said, the 3D look terrible.- Display brightness adjusts for day/night.As for features that other GPS have and TomTom doesn't:- No security. My Sony comes with optional password protection. It doesn't make the GPS unusable if you forget the password but it WILL erase everything before allowing you in. This is very important if you GPS is stolen because you don't want the thief to know where you live. It could be argued that the ease of taking the unit out of the mount mitigates the lack of password protection but I'd prefer an electronic lock's permanent peace of mind.- My old Garmin would turn itself on automatically when the car charger supplied power and turn itself off when it didn't unless I specifically agreed that it should continue on battery. This eliminated the need to turn the GPS on/off all the time.- My Sony GPS made it very easy for me to organize my 'favorites' into many separate folders. By comparison, TomTom's handling of 'favorites' is quite primitive.- Also the Sony came with a 'motion detection' capability where it would estimate your vehicle's position even when satellite contact was lost - inside a garage or in a tunnel. TomTom does not have that.My rating is a 4 stars. Other than the terrible low-resolution, few-colors display and the lack of password protection, this GPS unit comes pretty close to 'excellent' for its size and price. The navigation is first class and the free maps and 'traffic' add value to an already good gadget. A better display would have made this GPS unit a serious contender to 'best in class' status.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[0, 0]",Maybe not 'best in class' but good overall,2011,02, 20,,4834,849,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20110220

It will NOT connect 2 regular components such as a TV and a receiver. The MINI connector is smaller/thinner and is meant for portable devices. However, you must make sure that your device needs a MINI because HDMI 1.4 added the Type D connector, oalso known as a MICRO connector which is even smaller/thinner than the MINI so make sure that you get the right cable.It should work well with anything that supports HDMI 1.3x that needs a MINI connector but it's built to comply with the higher HDMI 1.4 or HDMI 1.4a standard. You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support the HDMI 1.4 standard. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future.Unless either of the above is true, you will not need this cable and, given that the HDMI 1.4 standards aren't set in stone yet - the HDMI 1.4a was released recently - you should be better off waiting for the dust to settle if you don't need it today. Keep in mind that BOTH connected devices need to support the HDMI 1.4 standard for this cable to make a difference and that it is NOT possible to upgrade any existing equipment (TV, Blu-ray player) to support HDMI 1.4.As far as HDMI 1.4 stands, this cable is the complete implementation. It supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features.HOW GOOD IS IT?- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.Get this cable if you need to connect with something that needs a MINI connector. Even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel.

It is USB 2.0 certified, meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and, if your device accepts a Micro-B plug, this is the cable to get. Maybe the 2-meter length (6+ ft.) is a little bit too much but it does not bother me a lot and there may come a time when a cable this long may come in handy.I am awarding this item 5 stars for price, quality and for not making any special 'claims' as a pretext to charge an inflated price. It's note the absolute cheapest but, being an Amazon brand returning it if it's not what you needed or while under warranty should be as painless as these types of transactions go - I am speaking out of personal experience here.And, YES, it DOES work with the latest Kindle and YES, you can use with with a Blackberry Bold and most smart phones and Bluetooth headsets.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need. If in doubt, do some more research or call the maker's tech support.","[1, 1]",Standard USB but the Amazon brand is a big plus,2011,03, 24,1.0,2111,385,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20110324

You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. Again, on a pair of connected HDMI 1.4 devices, it will eliminate the need of a dedicated audio cable if, let's say, your TV needs to send sound back to your receiver - it may have a built-in Blu/DVD player or get its input through an USB port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future.As far as HDMI 1.4 stands, this cable is 'it'. It's the complete implementation because it supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features.HOW GOOD IS IT?- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.You may want to get this cable even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard and, with free shipping the price difference is not that great. And, keep in mind that Amazon stands behind this product so returns should be easy.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[205, 241]","HDMI 1.4/1.3x cable, get full support from Amazon",2010,12, 15,0.8506224066390041,4790,802,Positive,205,241,36,0.027910763719263963,20101215

Not surprisingly, when it comes to Logitech gadgets, quality stays high even at the less expensive low end. The M310's are some of the prettiest no frills wireless mice you can buy and they perform well too. And, calling them 'no frills' may not be entirely fair because these mice, besides being 'pretty' - and at the time of this review Logitech had five colors/patterns styles - they are also good mice and I am in fact planning to keep using my 'Red Tendrils' as my office mouse.Very briefly, this is what the M310's have going for them:- EASE OF INSTALLATION -On purpose, I attempted to set up my mouse without looking at the 'manual', a folded, English/Spanish/French 'Getting started with' sheet. 3 minutes later I was using my new mouse. Everything was quick and easy, beginning with the 'Easy Open' tab that allowed me to quickly take the mouse out of the bullet-proof plastic enclosure and do it without heavy-duty shears.Installation goes like this: insert the supplied AA battery into the mouse body, plug the small 'nano' receiver into a USB port... THE END. You are ready to use the mouse. Or so it went on my Windows 7 laptop. By the way, I plugged it into a docking station USB port and it worked without a problem.- SIMPLICITY -This is the mouse 'for the rest of us'. There's no need to install anything from Web sites or discs and the 'buttons' are down to the minimum: left button, right button and a clickable scrolling wheel. And there is an on-off button on the bottom but you don't need to worry about that because the mouse will turn itself off when not used for a while. And, THERE IS NO MANUAL, because there's no need for one.- EFFICIENT, INNOVATIVE -There are quite a few power-saving features that should allow the mouse to operate for up to 12 months on one AA battery, or so Logitech claims. Besides the auto-off feature, there are no LEDs and the 'laser' seems to be a very low power one because no visible light is emitted.The 'nano' style receiver becomes almost invisible once plugged into a USB port. This is a very good thing, especially if you are using this with a laptop or a Netbook.- DESIGN, ERGONOMICS -The M310 is a lot more than a pretty face but being pretty does not hurt. Sure you can pick the 'silver' style but if 'violet' or 'blue' or the more flamboyant 'red tendrils' or 'big top stripes' match your environment and your lifestyle, you can get one.The symmetric shape ensures that the mouse can be operated with ease either right or left-handed. Buttons can be swapped and some customization is available with Logitech's SetPoint 6.1 software installed (see note).This is a 'medium size' mouse with a comfortable shape. The rubberized sides allow for an easy, comfortable grip.- SPECS -I only used the M310 on a Windows 7 but Logitech claims that it should also work on XP, Vista and MacOS X 10.4 or later. As I mentioned already, a USB port is needed.What you get for you money is the mouse, the nano receiver, one AA battery and the quick setup guide (not really needed).Logitech promises a 3-year limited warranty with the emphasis on 'limited'.- EVALUATION -I am very happy with this mouse and anyone who wants a basic mouse should be happy with it. Following a few weeks of use, I was unable to detect any shortcomings. I am compelled to rate the M310 a 5-star.______________________________________Note:Even though I couldn't find any reference in the supplied documentation, some customization is possible via SetPoint 6.1 which can be downloaded from Logitech - search for M310, select your operating system and you should be able to download the software. Once installed, SetPoint will allow you to:- swap right/left buttons- assign specific functions to the middle button/wheel- configure the scrolling size- control pointer speed/acceleration- check battery status- enable 'game mode'These are all nice things but I was happy with the defaults. Left-handed users may WANT to download SetPoint.UPDATE - March 2, 2011Battery seems to last forever. 7 months later, I'm still on the first battery.","[27, 28]","So pretty - inexpensive, easy to setup/use too",2010,07, 7,0.9642857142857143,4255,729,Positive,27,28,1,0.023253541768441622,20100707

Nothing more than simple playback should be expected from it but, so far, it has played everything without a glitch. The picture is steady and crisp and so is the audio. There was no skipping so far and old DVDs that became unplayable on the DVD player that it's replacing can be watched again and play flawlessly.First, for what the player lacks: Internet access. There is no Ethernet port and there is no WiFi - therefore there will never be Netflix or Pandora streaming or anything that needs a network connection. In addition there is no easy way to upgrade it or, if it's upgradeable, the capability is not documented in the manual.On the positive side, besides the basic playback, this model does a pretty good job upscaling DVDs and has an SD slot - it supports SD, (miniSD and microSD will need an adapter) and SDHC and it does NOT support miniSDHC or microSDHC cards. You should be able to display JPEG pictures. Another welcome feature is its going into standby mode if no action is taken for a few minutes while displaying the 'menu'.Available ports include HDMI Out, Audio Out, Component Video Out, Digital Out (coax) and Video Out.The player came with a small and easy to use remote control (batteries included), a 50-page manual and an RCA component video cable.I have no complaints about this model.

This is not an exaggeration. It had greasy, visible fingerprints and palm prints all over it and I had to spend quite a while cleaning it up. It was also scratched. The scratches were minor but it was scratched nevertheless. The manual is a stapled Xerox copy of the original but it's readable. I understand that 'refurbished' is a rather fuzzy concept but I've been spoiled by the 'like new', quality of refurbished items I received from Linksys or Logitech. This unit arrived in a far from 'like new' condition.Related to the not exactly 'like new' quality of this refurbished product, it's worth noting that the original 1 year Maganvox warranty does not apply. Instead, you get a 90-days warranty that ""does not apply to the cosmetic appearance"" (a quote). In addition, the buyer is expected to pay for shipping.____________________________________________________I don't know if I should consider myself lucky for receiving a working unit but I can only review the product that I received which, once cleaned and hooked up to the TV worked well. The lack of high-end features is not a disappointment or a surprise and it's compensated by the low price. The apparent lack of support is a concern but, again, this is not an expensive product. The 3 stars are well deserved for what I got but I would not recommend this as a 'buy' to anyone who wants to play it perfectly safe or is shopping for a unit that should last for several years.MARCH 12, 2011 UPDATE:4 months later, I like it more.

The entertainment center use did not work for me because more than 2 of my gadgets don't like to be shut down completely and only one or two would benefit from this feature. On my home office though, I just love taking down the speakers, the monitor, the several chargers and the docking station. I'm not sure how long it will take for this to 'pay for itself' but, since I was going to replace the old surge protector anyway, I had no problem going with this one.This surge protector allows for up to 10 devices to be plugged in but it makes no special accommodations for the wider DC adapters. It will protect them against power surges and it also does pass-thru protection for one coax wire. What makes it 'special' is, of course, the remote control that will completely shut off all but 2 of the outlets so nothing, not even stand-by power is consumed. This is good because it saves some energy and I suspect that the devices for which the power was completely shut down are better protected in the event of a spike. With the remote on my desk, I found that I almost always remember to shut things down when I'm done.More details------------The following are noteworthy, in my view.Positives:+ Simple remote control with a 60 ft. range and no line of sight requirement to turn off all but 2 of the outlets - it's what makes this device special.+ On-Off switch could be mounted on a wall (mounting screws not provided) or simply glued to the wall or the side of your desk (adhesive tape provided).+ 10-outlet capacity but must be creative with the placement of the wider AC adapters. Two of them can sit comfortably at the end where the cable guides are. The remaining six outlets that can be switched off are a little crowded though so your true 'power saving' capacity (not counting the permanently one outlets which I don't use at this time) could be 4 AC and 2 regular plugs - see the note at the bottom of this review for an alternative solution.+ 'Always on' light shows that power is present.+ 'Not grounded' red light (must be off) will warn you when there's something wrong. Belkin's warranty won't apply if the light was on when your devices got fried. I don't know if for a fact but I assume they have a way of telling if that was the case.+ 'Remote-Switched Outlets' light shows when switched outlets are active.+ Manual override button allows for direct control of switched outlets. A must have when the remote's battery needs replacing.+ Clip for cable management. Its best feature is it being removable because removing it was the only way I could squeeze in my 2 widest AC adapters.+ Thin (one inch) and flat shape. Sits well on any flat surface, usually the floor.+ Coax cable pass through for surge protection but Belkin's warranty does NOT cover damage through surges through the coax (think lightning hitting your satellite dish).+ It's possible to control several similar devices with one remote control or have each respond to its own on-off remote - the manual shows you how to set them up.+ 4 foot long cord.Negatives:- Crowded placement of 6 of the 8 'switched' outlets creating potential problems when you are plugging in many wide AC adapters. The only place the really wide adapters can live is near the cable guide clip but ONLY after you remove it.- The little manual was written for a different model that has only 6 switched outlets but it does cover the current product's feature.- The warranty statement promises up to $100,000 coverage for equipment damaged due to surges but it explicitly excludes anything coming through the coax (lightning?) and the way it's worded, it would probably cost you more to fulfill the requirements and prove your case than whatever you are likely to get IF you are successful.Rating------I like Belkin's opting for simplicity - click and you're done - over the more complex semi-intelligent energy saving power strips that many find difficult to set up and don't always perform the way one expects. With me in control, at least I won't be blaming someone else if something goes wrong. I currently have one 'always on' outlet in use and 5 'switched' outlets and the 3 remaining ones are still usable - not 'covered' that is. The 5 outlets that I can turn off at the end of my workday should probably not waste 25-35W each hour for 12+ hours each workday plus weekends. Not bad and it should probably fully pay for itself after about a year of use.I am awarding 5 stars to this 4.5 stars item that addresses real issues by providing a realistic solution. It's possible that the power strip of the future are going to be a lot more intelligent than today's but, until then, this is the optimal solution for me.__________________________________________________Note:If you have more than 2 wide AC adapters, the better choice may beBelkin Conserve Switch F7C01008q Energy-Saving Surge with Remote. It has 2 fewer switched outlets (six instead of eight) but all six can be wide AC adapters.","[27, 27]",Simple and effective solution to a real problem,2011,04, 22,1.0,5146,896,Positive,27,27,0,0.02328610975411171,20110422

I didn't know whether it was going to work (very old machine) so I picked this one because of the price - not much to lose if it didn't work - and because of the other great reviews.I went straight to the RT3070 directory because a sticker on the mini-disc's wrapping had that printed on it and shared the executable found in the Windows folder on the network. Had to do that because the old computer's CD drive doesn't work any longer. To make the story short, the installation lasted about 2 minutes. I suggest to pick 'install driver only' when prompted. Then... inserted the adapter into an USB port and... the wireless network was immediately detected. As soon as I entered the security key we were zipping at 150 Mbps which is about FIFTEEN TIMES faster than before.To end the story I'd like to say this: I simply can't think of a reason for spending more if all you need is an 802.11n adapter for a Windows computer.

The part that plugs into your computer's USB port slides in and out of the protective casing and you ergonomically control it with your thumb. This makes this drive 'smaller' which may or may not be a good thing if you misplace it :) This and its good I/O speed make me love this Cruiser but anyone uncomfortable with removing preinstalled software from the drive and or formatting it should look elsewhere (see the 'warning' paragraph).I bought this refurbished because it was dirt cheap - less than 50 cents per GB at the time of purchase - but, it turns out, affordability is not the only feature  worth discussing. I will list what I believe to be the positives/negatives below.+ Low price: spectacularly low at the time of purchase, likely to go lower because flash drive prices seem to be in a free fall.+ Large capacity: 32 GB is quite decent and should hold 5, possibly 6 DVD movies ripped to the highest DVD settings, menus, subtitles, audio tracks and extra features included.+ I/O not bad: benchmarked by me at 128 Mbit/s (16MB/s) reading large media files when formatted as FAT32 with 64KB clusters.+ Small physical size.+ The retractable capability protects the connector without the need of a removable and easy to lose cap.- Moving parts: the 'retractable' feature is nice but one thing that I used to like about thumb drives was 'no moving parts' which gave me more peace of mind when trusting them with important data. Occasionally my first attempt to push it into the USB port fails and I need to 'click it' into the extended position and try again.- Annoying pulsating light: there's no way to turn it off.- Obsolete SanDisk's U3 Launchpad app pre-installed and not easy to remove save for re-formatting.I will award this drive 4 stars mostly for the price (very low), acceptable I/O speed and for its storage capacity. It's not the 'perfect' USB drive - see the 'minuses' listed above but the good features are good enough to make me 'like it' which is Amazon's standard for 4 stars.

So, to make it clear, the unit that I am reviewing - and I did receive a free 'for review' unit from vendor - does NOT come with a backlit keyboard and does NOT have Bluetooth capabilities. However, I do like it and most of us should be happy with it at this price (under 20 dollars when I am writing this).First impressions, confirmed by my testing are of 'ease of use'. The lack of Bluetooth is mitigated by the nice USB dongle that is safely stored inside the keyboard's body while not in use. This makes 'pairing' with computers that have USB ports as easy as sticking in the dongle and... it's done.The 'thumbs' keyboard is not so bad and all most keys, except for some media functions do not require the use of some special function key combination. The few special ones, including a nice Ctrl+Alt+Del shortcut are truly 'a few' and they are clearly labelled and color-coded. I found the touchpad sensitive and responsive enough for it to work well with most jobs involving presentations, which is what the Favi is mostly meant for. You have no control over the pad's sensitivity but, the way it is, it's a good compromise. It's also sensitive to taps. The arrow keys and the keys for the left/right mouse buttons are also a good thing to have. And, of course, there is the laser pointer which works whether the Favi is paired with a computer or not, just turn the device on and press the laser button.The Favi came with a charging USB cable (but not charger) and a Quick Start Guide which is very much all that you need to make it work.It's a 5 star rating because the low price mitigates the lack of Bluetooth or of a backlit keyboard and most buying this with full knowledge of that Favi does and does not do should be happy with it.","[2, 2]",Happy with it at this price,2014,06, 11,1.0,1968,356,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20140611

It's not audiophile quality and it's not 'surround' - the attempts at subwoofer emulation are not always convincing - but it's head and shoulders above what I can get out of my laptop's built-in speakers.- VOLUME - It's somewhat higher than the max I can get out of the built-in speakers but it's not a lot louder. Given the power source (USB) and the Z's small sized I am not surprised.- 360-DEGREE - it comes pretty close, actually. You will get better audio behind your laptop, actually but it's close enough to 360-degree sound projection to accept Logitech's claim.- EASE OF INSTALLATION - On my Windows 7 laptop I simply plugged the 'Z' into an USB port and it was ready to use. Nothing else was needed.- PHYSICAL SETUP - It took about 2 seconds to clip the 'Z' to may laptop. The setup is exactly what the Amazon picture shows. The removal is as easy as the attachment.- DESIGN - When not in use, the Z305 resembles a folded umbrella in shape, weight and size. The clip folds into the body and there is a groove where the USB cable and plug are stored.- TRAVEL/STORAGE POUCH - It won't provide much fall protection but I agree with Logitech that it should protect your gadget from scratches.- AUX INPUT FOR MP3 PLAYER - I can't see myself ever trying that: power external speaker via USB (laptop), then attach the MP3 player to the speaker but... they put it in there. It doesn't hurt.- POWER, VOLUME UP/DOWN BUTTONS - Again, something not likely to use much given that there are so many alternative ways to control the sound other than reaching to the back of your laptop.OPERATION, USES------------------The way you operate the Z305 is like this: you take it out of the pouch, pull out the USB wire, clip it, plug it into a USB port, listen. When you're done, you do the above in reverse.By and large, Logitech's claims are true. The Z305 lives up to the marketing claims. BUT... is it needed? Assuming that the Z305 is meant to be used while traveling, obviously, it can't be for air travel so, maybe some may want to listen to laptop-stored music or watch video with better quality sound while in a hotel room? Possibly. And for THAT use, the Z305 is the perfect solution. I can also see how some may attach the Z305 while making a laptop-based presentation but my experience is that most presentations involve stored visuals while the 'audio' comes from the presenter. There may be some other good uses but I can't think of any at this time.RATING-------This is a high quality product, especially when the price is considered - in other words GOOD VALUE - but it's something that has rather limited uses in real life. I was happy to test this product from Logitech, I found no major faults and quite a few things to appreciate but, if the question is ""knowing that this is a good-quality, inexpensive, well designed enhanced sound solution for my laptop, would I actually buy a Z305?"" my answer is going to be 'no' because I can't think of any good, repeat use for it that could justify my purchase.My 4 star rating (I like it) reflects the the fact that I like the Z305 very much but I would not buy it.","[0, 0]",I like it,2010,10, 1,,3289,590,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20101001

Whatever falls in-between should be ignored and, if possible avoided. For the same reason I favor a Kindle over the more feature-rich 'reader' competition, I tend to favor the first class because I value simplicity and focus on the mission which, when it comes to mice, is 'pointing and clicking'.Surprisingly, the G700 happens to be one of those rare specimens that, while highly complex and feature-rich, can be also used in very much the same way any other simple point-and-click device is. Of course, it's a lot more expensive.CONTENTS, INSTALLATION, SETUP, etc.Logitech's G700 comes together with:* a male/male Type-A to Micro-B USB cord* a male/female Type-A to Type-A USB Nano range extender or extension cord to be used with the above when needed* Nano receiver* rechargeable AA battery (installed)* 'getting to know your mouse' and 'features' guides and other paperworkOut of the box, on a Windows 7 machine I had a working mouse within seconds of me plugging the little Nano receiver into a USB port. Once done, it was acting like any self-respecting, laser, wireless inexpensive 2-button plus wheel mouse.Configured (or rather not configured) this way, it's a large, well-shaped wide mouse that seems to be meant to fit the larger hands. It's also heavy so, if you are used to lift your mouse it may take a while to get used to it. The mouse is very responsive and other good features include:- right hand only- a 'gear shift' button that allow the wheel to roll either smoothly or with clicks- included rechargeable battery- Nano receiver storage inside the battery compartment- the ability to use it as a 'corded' mouse while charging it through the USB- an extra-long mouse cord if you attach the extension to the USB wire- on-off button- semi-rough finish that improves grip AND hides fingerprints- 3 year limited hardware warrantyBut, of course there is a lot more to it.CUSTOMIZATION AND MORE FEATURESThe first thing you notice is... BUTTONS. Depending on how you count them... let's say that there are 13 customizable buttons if you would count the tilting of the wheel to the left and to the right as 2 buttons. The count holds if you do NOT count the wheel itself, the wheel's gear shift button and the On/Off button - because they are not customizable. But, let's enumerate the possibilities:- 13 fully customizable buttons- status lights showing battery charge level, profile in use, polling level- up to FIVE profiles, meaning that each button can be assigned a separate function on each of the profiles- the ability to swap right click/left click buttons- 3 power profiles (saving, gaming and extreme gaming)- 5 selectable polling rates from 125 to 1000 reports/second- 5 adjustable levels of sensitivity, anything between 200 and 5700 dpi- configurable speed, acceleration, scrolling speed- ability to assign applications to specific profiles- change profiles either manually (mouse controls) or via automatic application detection- profile manager- macro manager- macro recorder can capture keyboard, mouse clicks (not movement) or both- optional on-screen notification of 'battery low' condition- all customization implemented the SetPoint software, available for download at Logitech's siteButtons distribution is as follows:* 4 buttons for your thumb* 3 buttons on the left side for your index finger* clickable wheel (they count it as 3 buttons for its right/left tilts) plus one button in the middle for either middle finger or index* right click and left click buttonsGAMING vs. EVERYTHING ELSEI assume that the G in G700 stands for gaming and you can take advantage of the buttons/profiles while in game mode. I will admit that I am more of a console gamer these days but my kid who IS an intense PC gamer snatched the G700 away from me a couple of days ago and he's not giving it back. However, before that I almost got myself spoiled by the ability to assign page up/page down to the G4/G5 buttons, Delete/Undo to G6/G7, Show Desktop to the 'Wheel Click'. And note that I still assign 'things' to 4 more buttons if I didn't care about the current defaults - they are currently use to 'battery status', 'switch profiles' and increase/decrease DPI. And this would be only ONE of the five possible profiles.The reason for the paragraph above is because I wanted to make it clear that 'gaming' may be this mouse's intended use but it could easily make itself useful as a 'business mouse' if it's okay to say this.MY RATINGThe G700 would be an easy 5 stars - because I do 'love it' - if it weren't for it's rather large size and heavy weight. I do not mind it myself because my hands are not small but I understand that not everyone will be comfortable with it. So, this will be a 5 stars for the quality of its built, extreme versatility and its 'default' ease of use BUT with the understanding that it is large and heavy so it may not be for everyone.________________________________________UPDATE (5/24/13):The G700 continues to be my preferred mouse.

Anyone (such as myself) who currently relies on 'wireless' to connect various devices could use Livewire Powerline for those networked appliances that either can't connect wirelessly (many Bluray players and TV sets) or a high bandwidth channel is needed to stream HD content.Before making a 'buy' decision, it is important to understand that Livewire will NOT significantly improve 'Internet' performance unless your ISP provides you with a very large bandwidth. If your Wi-Fi router supports 802.11g, you will get an average throughput of 22 Mbit/s which is more than most ISP can provide for Internet bandwidth. In other words, your Wi-Fi router should usually handle whatever the Internet may throw at you with some room to spare and whether you get your ISP's 10 Mbit/s data stream over at 22 Mbit/s from Wi-Fi or at 200 Mbit/s from Livewire Powerline it's still... 10 Mbit/s or close. On the other hand, streaming form your media server at will make all the difference in the world when compared with your Wi-Fi throughput.WHO NEEDS IT?To summarize, you will BENEFIT from Liverwire Powerline when:- You stream from YOUR media server- Have some Internet-ready device that does not support Wi-Fi and your home is not 'wired' for Ethernet- You have a big house or for whatever reason Wi-Fi can't reach some specific device or the reception is poor- You have a VERY HIGH bandwidth Internet connectionYou will NOT BENEFIT from Liverwire Powerline to connect to the Internet via a 'normal' broadband link and, of course, if your house is already wired for Ethernet.MY EXPERIENCETo evaluate WD's Livewire Powerline I decided that I will first try it without reading the manual (a .pdf) or installing whatever software came on CD. To my surprise, I was able to set it all up and get it running in a few minutes. Still haven't looked at the CD.In the box you find the 2 little (literally) identical Liverwire Powerline boxes, 2 power cords and 2 short (too short) Ethernet wires. And... yes a CD that should have some software that you COULD install and use if you had trouble setting things up. The boxes have 4 RJ-45 (not phone jacks) ports, an On/Off switch set to On by default (no need to ever set it to off) and some little lights that blink whenever there is data traffic.My setup and installation proceeded as follows:- I connected the power cords to the boxes- On each of the 2 boxes I connected one end of the Ethernet wires to one port on the box- I placed one of the boxes near my router in the basement and connected the other end of the Ethernet wire to one of the router's ports- I plugged the power cord into a wall outlet - must NOT plug it into a power strip or surge protector, it MUST go directly into the wall outlet- I attached the Ethernet wire of the other box to my PS3 upstairs- I plugged this box's power cord into the wall outletOnce the above was done, I turned on my PS3 and set it to use the 'wired' connection. It recognized it within seconds and I was pleased to see the Internet test indicating an 8.2 Mbit/s, better than the 5.6 Mbit/s I had over the Wi-Fi. But that was not all. The big improvement was when I played a video off the media server located in the basement: flawlessly playing our 720p home videos over the new connection vs. choppy before over Wi-Fi.As expected, the PS3 benefited but only to a small degree when it came to the Internet stream - it did benefit because the Wi-Fi signal strength was only 63% -  and it benefited tremendously when media streaming was between in-house devices.With 4 RJ-45 ports available, I am considering now getting a dedicated Blu-ray player and will not have to specifically seek one that had Wi-Fi built-in.MY EVALUATIONAs far as I am concerned (see my experience notes above) Livewire Powerline is in many ways the perfect gadget. It does its magic, it does it well and 'the rest of us' don't need to bother with manuals or spend hours on hold with tech support - WD does provide a tech support phone number and a Web site if you get yourself into trouble.I do not expect not think about this device again until I get my Blu-ray player. Like my Linksys router, I expect it to sit there, largely forgotten and gathering dust behind the entertainment center and do its job without me worrying about it at all. Which makes it perfect. And the price is not that bad either._________________________________NOTE: WD claims that this will allow you to stream HD on your home network. This is true but be aware that not all HDs are equal.

The receiver can be connected to any device that accepts RCA video and audio inputs and it will produce an audible warning/alarm when motion is detected. The receiver can wirelessly control up to 4 cameras (one camera included) and, in turn, can be operated by the provided IR remote control.I wish I could say 'for sure' that this is a bad product or that it's an Okay thing - the difference between 2 and 3 stars - but I can't. I will settle for 2 stars at this time but I am open to any new facts or corrections that would warrant one extra star.KIT CONTENTSIn the box, you will find the camera, the receiver, power adapters for both, RCA wire with plugs for video and mono audio, an IR extension wire, 4 window stickers announcing that the property is protected and the manual.INSTALLATION AND SETUPI was disappointed to learn that  the only way you can connect to a TV/monitor is over an ANALOG RCA interface - quite unexpected from a product that calls itself 'digital'. Our living room TV has 3 HDMI ports, 2 component video banks and the traditional coax for inputs. NO 'yellow' RCA for Video In. The solution was to go through a receiver and from 'it' to TV's 'component analog video' but I expected better and less complicated.After that, the rest of the setup was quick and easy. The camera paired with the receiver automatically, the 2GB SD card was inserted into its slot, went through a couple of menus to set preferences and we were up and running.We haven't mounted the camera on a wall yet but everything needed appears to be there: mounting screws, bracket, even drilling templates.FEATURESThe Defender (I will use this as the short name from now on) is advertised as an advanced, versatile, easy to operate security solution. I will briefly list its most important (to me) features and compare 'advertised' vs. my reality/experience.- Optimal range of up to 100 ft. between receiver and camera - I placed the right outside the house with the receiver in the living room, easily less than 50 ft. between the two. I was surprised to notice that, even at this short distance the signal's strength will drop to 2 bars and occasionally drop altogether. Moving the receiver a few inches right or left or changing the antenna's position from vertical to horizontal would sometimes get me 3 or 4 bars. As a frame of reference, I have no reception problems whatsoever anywhere in the house or around the house with my DECT cordless phones or with my Wi-Fi. This is at odds with the advertised claim of 100 ft. combined with the claim that the system will intelligently search for and find some unused radio spectrum to use.- Night vision at up to 40 ft - I am happy to confirm that this is indeed the case. On a moonless night I was able to watch activity (our dogs that is) up to 40-50 ft. from camera's location. It should be noted that the 'infrared' LEDs do have a visible dark red glow so this can't be a stealth night surveillance camera.- Color camera - I can't tell if this is my receiver's inability to properly translate the one-channel analog RCA feed into 'component video' sent to the TV but what I get on my TV is honest to goodness black and white. This is strange because the recordings captured on the SD card are very much 'color' so either somewhere inside the Defender's own receiver or, possibly, inside my own, the picture turns to B&W.; Strange.- Clear sound and crisp image - No complaints about the microphone. The picture resolution is 640x480 (VGA) by default but you can take it down to 320x240 if you want. To me, the 'hi res' is barely adequate. In addition, the frame rate seems to be something in the range of 10-20 frames per second.- Coverage - It should be clear that this camera does NOT move (it's fixed in one position) and the only 'zoom' capability is a so-called fixed 2X 'digital zoom' which isn't real any zoom at all because you aren't getting any extra detail.- Motion detection - Check. It will detect motion up to 100 ft.- Motion-triggered recording - It works but there seems to be a delay of about one second between the moment motion was detected and the start of the recording. Somewhat annoyingly, the screen goes blank for one second upon motion detection if you happen to watch this 'live'. In addition, if you set your camera to record for 5 seconds following the detection of motion, the recording will stop after 5 seconds while the motion continued. You can set the recording time to 15 or 30 seconds following detection though so this is no such a big deal.- DVR capability - Indeed, the DS card will have folders named after the date YYMMDD and inside each folders you will have .AVI recordings labeled by 'time' HHMMSS' that can be easily played with MS's Media Player or just about any other app that plays video. You can set it to overwrite the oldest records when full so the 2GB card should get you several days, probably many days of motion activate records.- Weather resistant - I believe the specs state a temp range from 14F-116F. The temps do drop to and below zero where we live. I hope nothing bad will happen to the camera when this happens. Other than that, it comes with a aluminum cover and, since it tends to run pretty hot, I would expect for ice and snow to melt quickly off it.- Up to 4 cameras supported - Could not test that but the menus suggest that you could have all 4 camera feeds on one screen at the same time.OPERATIONWe set the camera up outside to overlook the driveway and to start recording whenever motion was detected. Once we found a good position for the receiver where it would consistently get at least 2 bars of signal strength, the camera operated well, doing what was expected of it, seeing through the night, detecting and recording motion until... we closed the garage door at which time the receiver could no longer communicate with our camera, located about 50 ft. away, outside. Opening the door would restore communication but we are not planning to keep the garage door permanently open. Raising the camera - me holding it above my head - restored communication while the garage door was closed but this is not a long-term solution. We are still debating what to do with the camera at this time, like maybe mount it somewhere high, possibly on the roof. I can think of a mode of operation where the receiver isn't connected to any display and, if you only interest is to see who came near the house, you simply take out the DS card and watch the daily records independently.The best use for this camera, if you aren't home during the day, is to be able to see who happened to be around the house in your absence. With 15 seconds of recording per detected motion all it takes is just a few minutes to 'see' the daily activity. I wish we had something like this a couple of months ago when, while we were on vacation, a package left for us in the driveway... disappeared.RATING+ Good, almost great, DVR functions+ Relatively simple easy setup+ Night vision as advertised+ Motion detection and motion-activated recording as advertised- Range grossly overstated- Terrible, antiquated analog interface to TV/monitor- Low resolution, low frame rateWhile this product comes with many good and useful capabilities, the shortcomings are quite serious - so serious, we are not sure we are going to actually 'use' it, now that the testing is done. Considering that this product isn't exactly 'cheap', while I still hesitate between 2 and 3 stars, I feel compelled to award it 2 stars.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[43, 50]","Good features, serious shortcomings",2010,09, 26,0.86,7705,1369,Negative,43,50,7,0.023579221625142484,20100926

Especially when the protected 'touch screen' is touched mostly with by fingers or generally soft objects.I was able to verify the claim that the cover will protect the screen from scratches. On the other hand, the claim that placing this on top of iPad's screen 'improves clarity' is clearly inaccurate. Placing an extra layer on top of the original screen can only reduce clarity even so slightly and it simply can't improve it. I can't express an opinion concerning the 'glare reduction' claim because I didn't have a sunny day to verify it during my testing. My subjective impression was that the iPad was slightly less responsive to touch while the screen was on, especially when using a stylus.This screen protector is delivered as kit, complete with instructions, a soft cloth for prepping the iPad's screen prior to applying the protector, the protector itself delivered in a pristine state between its own 2 protective layers and a little squeegee used to push any bubbles on the side. It is possible to install this and only have a few bubbles but doing it well is a learned skill and, at this price, it would have been nice if a 'practice' item came with the package.Considering that I personally dispute the need of any screen protector for an iPad, the difficult to justify (high) price, the imperfect outcome (bubbles) of my one attempt at installation and my subjective impression that the screen was slightly less responsive to touch post-installation, the fair rating for this product should be '3 stars'. I am not going to keep it on my iPad but I'm not going to have any screen protectors on mine. On the other hand, I respect the fact that some may want some protection for their gadget and, for anyone who needs one, this specific product is probably 'Okay' even though a little on the expensive side. Mitigating the high price is the Amazon-backed one-year warranty and my personal experience is that Amazon is very serious when it comes to honoring their commitments to customer satisfaction.","[0, 0]","Basic protector, basically not needed (in my view), not cheap",2011,02, 12,,2276,390,Neutral,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20110212

And these Monster positives are:+ Easily washable eartips (gels). This is quite important if the product is to be used as directed, while exercising.+ 5 sizes supplied: XS, S, M, L, XL.+ Ear wings make it a lot less likely for the earphone to fall off your ear.+ Supplied storage pouch that's not only cool-looking but made of quality materials and large enough to store both headphones and a small MP3 player.The product comes in a nice-looking cardboard box and there's 3-page (per each language) little manual that explains the fitting process quite well.Nothing can be perfect but these headphones can be easily called 'very good'. The sound quality is indeed very good (not great) and there is a control module attached to the wire that's ostensibly designed to work with iPhones/Pods and Blackberries but works well with generic MP3 players too.I am quite happy with the product.

I thought I'd better start with a little FAQ on the device. These are questions that I was asked by friends and coworkers who saw me playing with the Flips (got a 'second gen' too) and questions that I wished I had answers for if I was about to make a buy decision.__________________________________________________Q - If it stops working, is it easy to get a warranty replacement?A - Based on my experience with a 'second gen' model, no, but I did get it replaced after hours of online chatting with help support and escalating emails and phone calls.Q - Who makes the Flip?A - Flip was discontinued on April 12, 2011. It used to be made by Pure Digital Technologies which was acquired by Cisco sometime in 2009.Q - What do you get in the box?A - The Flip's body, a wrist strap, a micro fiber pouch and a Quick Start guide.Q - How large/portable is it?A - The light body is 4"" long, 2"" wide and less than 1/2"" thick. The display on the back is 2"" on the diagonal.Q - How easy/hard is it to operate?A - The Flip is very easy to operate. All you have is a power button on the side, a large, red start/stop (recording) push button on the back, up/down(zoom in/out), left/right, start playback and trash(delete) touch buttons.Q - How much video can be stored on the Flip?A - The 8GB internal storage holds up to 2 hours of video.Q - What is the resolution?A - I haven't seen it documented anywhere but it appears to be 1280 by 720.Q - Is there a way to control/change the image resolution?A - No. There is one fixed resolution and it can't be changed.Q - What file format is the Flip using?A - .MP4Q - Can the battery be replaced? How long does it last?A - The rechargeable battery pack can be replaced. You can also use 3 AAA's.Q - How long it takes to charge the battery?A - About 3-4 hours to fully charge an empty battery by plugging the Flip into you computer's USB port.Q - Is a charger included?A - No. The Flip is charged by inserting its 'flippable' USB arm into a computer USB port. A charger can be purchased separately at Flip's Web site. [UPDATE: I should have checked before I ordered it, Amazon has it too -Flip Video Power Adapter- for less but beware, the adapter itself comes without a charging cord so that would be yet another purchase.Q - Is the recorded video true HD?A - Yes. The output comes out as true HD resolution (see above) the colors are rich and vibrant and the image is sharp.Q - How good are the videos?A - The image is sharp and the sound is good too (regardless of light conditions). The Flip is pretty good at auto-focusing but it has no 'shake protection' whatsoever so if you are moving while shooting the output will suffer. I was able to shoot spectacular 'fireworks' videos with the Flip.Q - How good is the sound?A - The quality of recorded sound is surprisingly good for such a small unit.Q - How easy is it to record/operate?A - You turn on the Flip and when what you wish to record appears in the 2"" display, you push the red 'record' button. The up/down touch buttons allow you to zoom in/out. When you're done, you push the red button again.Q - Where are your videos stored?A - Once you plug the Flip into a computer's USB port, it will install its software on the computer and it will allow you to transfer your videos to the computer and optionally remove them from Flip's memory.Q - What else can you do with Flip's software?A - You can make 'movies' by joining video files and adding a title and credits, you can make video greeting cards, you can post your videos to YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, you can burn them on a DVD and you can play them back.Q - Is the Flip expandable or can it be customized in any way?A - No. The amount of storage is fixed, there are no memory card slots and the battery can't be replaced.Q - Can the Flip play videos directly on a TV?A - Yes. The Flip has a micro-HDMI port that can be used to connect it to a TV. A special HDMI cable (with a micro port) is needed to make this possible.Q - What else would you need to make great videos?A - The most helpful accessory would be a (mini)tripod. The Flip has a tripod mount and the best videos I was able to make were with the Flip mounted on one. I am usingQ:electronics Flexible Tripod (Charcoal Black)but Flip sell their own.__________________________________________________Now, my subjective judgement on the Flip follows.THINGS THAT I LIKE- small, very portable- excellent video resolution and the best overall picture quality for the price- great sound quality for a gadget this small- extreme ease of use- the tripod mount- holds and installs own software when plugged into a computer- easy to publish videos on YouTube/FacebookTHINGS THAT I DO NOT LIKE- no memory card slots- no optical image stabilization option (it does have 'eletronic image stabilization')My overall - and subjective impression - leans toward 'I almost love it'It's possible to produce incredibly good quality video with a tripod and some third-party video editing software but the quality suffers when the camera is handheld. The lack of an image stabilization feature CAN be addressed by video processing software but it would have been nice if it was there.I liked the ease with which the Flip interfaced with my computer and the ability to quickly transfer you 2 hours of stored video to your computer/laptop almost compensates for the lack of expansion slots. In the end, weighing Flip's ability to produce good video with minimum effort against the 'negatives' should yield a rating that's 'in between' 4 and 5 stars but I will grant it 4 because the makers should be encouraged to do 'better' :)-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[6, 6]",FAQ on the Ultra,2011,03, 23,1.0,6429,1143,Positive,6,6,0,0.022602182055039895,20110323

In addition, if your goal is storing data independently of any specific piece of equipment - camera, reader, music player - their size/bulk is an advantage because it's so much easier to lose or break an SD card once it's out of its host.Briefly, this is what it's worth knowing about this item:- I can't see that I've had a big problem with losing caps but the 'capless' design is quite innovative and it does not hurt.- It's fast enough to support video transfer but, of course, it does not come close to the theoretical 60MB/sec max I/O speed that the USB 2.0 specification allows.- Installs itself and does not require any software to be recognized as a 'drive' on a Vista or XP computer. Can't speak for other operating systems.- It formats and partitions as any 'spinning' drive.- Can be used to store data, to attach to players (my car plays MP3s off an USB drive) or to move it between unconnected devices.- Tolerable when used with apps that require some moderate I/O but I would not try to make it a swap drive.When it comes to Kingston - and, over the years and as prices were falling and the capacity grew, I've bought their 2GB, 4GB, 8GB and now the 16GBs - they never let me down.

I am not saying that the XOOM is perfect, far from it - and I will discuss its imperfections shortly - but, as tablets go in the second half of of 2011, the XOOM met and it occasionally exceeded my expectations more often than the other brands I tried. The disappointments were few and non-essential.After a couple of months with tablets I can say that using one CAN be a fun and rewarding experience IF one's expectations are realistic therefore...WHAT NOT TO EXPECTDo not believe the technical press hype announcing the imminent demise of the PC at the hands of the all-mighty tablet.

Trying to choose between a tablet and a PC/laptop is a false choice. While my XOOM and my T400 laptop can live happy and separate lives, my (computing) life would be impossible with just the XOOM and, now that I've been using it for several weeks, I would miss my XOOM if it disappeared from my life but I could probably live without one.- The on-screen keyboard can't replace the physical thing. It CAN be used to write brief notes or messages but between a tablet keyboard, even one with auto-fill and even the much smaller Blackberry physical alternative, I prefer the physical one. I'm using a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard with my XOOM when I need to 'really' type something and I don't feel like picking up my laptop.- Touch is fun but it's not a mouse. Consider that your index finger is way bigger than the mouse pointer's 'point' and the tablet screen is much smaller. Touch works better than mouse in some instances like in pinch-zoom and scrolling but not in most instances.- Of the 'hundreds of thousands' there are not a lot of 'serious' or full-featured apps at this time at least when it comes to 'creating' content as opposed to playing/consuming it. Tablets are limited by their specific interfaces and by their horsepower even though they do come with features (GPS, compass, thermometer, barometer) not commonly found in PCs. For example, the official 'Adobe Photoshop Express' I downloaded offers less than 1% of what you are likely to find in the 'real' Photoshop. It's ingeniously adapted to 'touch' but if you really wanted to edit your pics, you'd probably pick the real thing.- Due to their size, tablets can't and won't be replacing postage stamp-size MP3 players that can store thousands of songs AND fit in one's shirt pocket.- Streaming to a tablet from a media server may be possible but the tablet's tiny speakers can't deliver a rewarding listening experience. Sure, you can add some speakers but the more you add to a tablet (speakers, keyboard, mouse...) the less of a tablet it becomes.- It's possible to add a physical keyboard, a mouse or touch pad and even connect a larger display to the tablet but then... we'd end up with yet another netbook or a mini-laptop.WHY A TABLETAnd yet tablets are magical and I'm having more fun with mine. And here's why:- The XOOM sits to the left of my keyboard in the morning, playing the morning news shows while I'm having breakfast and reading my email.- There is this app that has over a thousand old movies and I often play one at lunch.- I'm making phone calls and video calls. My PC and my laptop can do that too but I now prefer to do my calls on the tablet while the PC does what PCs do best - crunch spreadsheet numbers, help me write and edit long documents and edit pictures and video to near-perfection.- At night, me and the kids learn about the stars, thanks to one free app that takes advantage of the tablet's built-in GPS and compass, showing the stars and constellations exactly as we see them and showing their names.- My 8 yr. old daughter finds playing math games with a stylus a lot more fun than pencil and paper or PC-based math drills.- There is an enormous amount of mostly-free games that kids like to play on the XOOM, many of them mind-bending puzzles which should be good for them.- If you are one of the passengers, it's fun to watch the satellite view or the street view of the places you're driving through.- It's got 3-4 times the battery life of my current laptop.XOOM vs. THE OTHERSLet me begin with what I 'like':- It's Wi-Fi and it's not 3G or 4G. In other words I pay less, I don't worry about 'usage' and I'm free to use my tablet as I please. I thought I'd mentioned that because  every single listing in Amazon's app store comes with the disclaimer stating that ""AT&T; has enabled purchases from the Amazon Appstore for some devices"". And that's a shame - being at the mercy of someone you actually pay to provide a service not to boss you around. AT&T; has zero control over my Wi-Fi XOOM.- It's an Android and that means freedom or at least more freedom than the iWorld. I can download and run anything I want and nobody can stop me from doing so. Sure, freedom implies some risks but... it's so much sweeter than the uniform world of 'managed' so-called eco- (or is it echo) systems.- The XOOM is a PURE Android. There are no phone-company super-imposed overlays and, after trying a couple other tablets, I found that I like it this way.- The XOOM happens to be an extraordinarily well-built tablet. Solid as a rock, as far as tablets go.- Accessorizing is easy and inexpensive. Any Bluetooth keyboards and headsets work well but haven't tried a mouse yet.Now, for what is not so great:- The charge port is at the bottom, meaning that you can't easily charge your tablet while it's on a stand. Sure, you can turn it upside down but and end up with the ports at the top but a charge port on one side would have been a lot better.- Can't use it outside at all other than as a mirror. The display is a highly-reflective glass. It looks great indoors and indoors only.- The fingerprints. Every touch leaves a visible print on the screen. You must either train yourself to ignore them, wipe the display every few minutes or use a stylus. I'm using a stylus myself and I'm wiping it often.- And, talking about 'stylus'. It would have been so nice if the XOOM came with a stylus storage compartment, the way DSi's do.- A little heavy for reading in bed. But I have a Kindle for that and it's in no danger of being replaced by the XOOM.MY RATINGI like the XOOM and I'm using it every day now even though I don't have to. And I suspect that the kids - who all have their own laptops - like it more because every time I put it down they pick it up. I am happy with it because I don't expect it to replace my laptop, my big screen TV or my home server. The XOOM and tablets are ideal for casual entertainment but can't do what more powerful and more dedicated devices can deliver. The XOOM is fun in the way a bike is fun. It's great riding it but you won't go shopping or take your family on a 60-mile trip to the beach on a bicycle.I will grant my XOOM its five stars because I truly love it and Amazon's 5-star rating stands for 'I love it'. It doesn't mean that the XOOM is perfect or that using it isn't frustrating from time to time. It only means that I love it and I'm glad I got mine.P.S. - for best results, I'd recommend accessorizing with a stand, a Bluetooth keyboard, a stylus and a couple of microfiber cloths.______________________________________________Aug 10, 2011 UpdateApparently the XOOM just earned Apple's seal of approval. The XOOM and Samsung's Tab 10.1 are the 2 tablets Apple is trying to get banned in Europe.","[43, 47]",Are you experienced?

Dent ""Aragorn""",1302652800,5.0,B0049MOJ2U,"04 13, 2011","I wouldn't call myself a rechargeable battery specialist but, following the purchase of 2 'robots' for the kids that EACH require 12 AA batteries to operate my options were either go 'rechargeable' or quickly go bankrupt. So, after some research, I went with the kits. Now, that we've used them for a while, I can say that I am happy with what we got and we are likely to go 'Eneloop' again if we ever need more AA/AAA in the future.THE KIT'S CONTENTSIt's probably worth stating that the kit comes with 16 (SIXTEEN) batteries: there are 12 AA and 4 AAA batteries in the kit. There are NO C-cell or D-cell batteries. The kit also contains 2 D-cell and 2 C-cell ADAPTERS which are empty shells that, when used with an AA battery allow you to use them in devices that expect a D-cell or a C-cell battery. So, this is what's in the kit:- 12 AA batteries, pre-charged- 4 AAA batteries, pre-charged- 2 C-cell adapters- 2 D-cell adapters- 1 battery charger (can charge up to 4 of any AA/AAA combination)BATTERIES, ADAPTERSThese are 1.2V, 750/800 mAh (AAA) and 1900/2000 mAh (AA) Ni-MH batteries. According to Sanyo, they easily beat the 'regular Ni-MH' competition when it comes to retaining their charge. According to Sanyo, the eneloops retain about 90% of their charge after 6 months and 85% after one year. Why is this important when it comes to rechargeable batteries? I don't know. What I do know is that I've been using Eneloops for quite a while and I've been a happy user so far. Moreover, if 'authority' can be invoked, my G700 Logitech gaming mouse came with an Eneloop battery in it so there must be something good about a brand that both myself and Logitech have been using for a while.The C and D adapters are little plastic 'shells' of what the real thing would look like. They are designed in such a way that, with an AA battery properly inserted, you can use them 'as if' they were C or D batteries. They look okay and I was able to verify that they work as expected.THE CHARGERWorth noting about the charger is its folding plug. This means that you are plugging it directly into your outlet. Which also means that you need to find some outlet where the adapter's width is not an issue. You can charge up to 4 AA or AAA batteries at any time. The adapter has 2 two-battery banks, each with its own status light. Sanyo claims that it will charge ANY Ni-MH rechargeable battery and I have no reason to doubt that this is indeed the case.MY RATINGI am very happy with these kits because they are saving me a lot of money. I went with the kit because, even though what I needed the most was 2 dozen AA's, I also needed as many chargers as possible and I could use a couple of rechargeable AAAs. The other thing I like about the Eneloops is their color. I know that it may not seem too relevant but the fact is that we lost MANY rechargeable batteries by throwing them away because we forgot they were rechargeable and we forgot because they looked 'just like' the other batteries. The white Eneloops stand out and it is not likely that we will throw them away.For the so-far flawless battery performance, hard-to-miss color, universal Ni-MH charger and the innovative C and D cell adapters, I can say that I do love these kits and they get my 5-star rating.","[3, 3]",Using lots of batteries?

The part that plugs into your computer's USB port slides in and out of the protective casing and you ergonomically control it with your thumb. This makes this drive 'smaller' which may or may not be a good thing if you misplace it :) This and its good I/O speed make me love this Cruiser but anyone uncomfortable with removing preinstalled software from the drive and or formatting it should look elsewhere (see the 'warning' paragraph).I bought this refurbished Cruiser because it was dirt cheap - less than $1/GB at the time of purchase - but, it turns out, there's more worth discussing and I will list what I believe to be the positives/negatives below.+ Low price: spectacularly low at the time of purchase (March, 2011).+ Large capacity: not the largest but 16GB is not too bad. It can easily hold TWO movies ripped to the highest DVD settings, menus, subtitles, audio tracks and extra features included.+ Speedy: benchmarked by me at 128 Mbit/s (16MB/s) reading large media files when formatted as FAT32 with 64KB clusters.+ Small physical size: can be attached to a key ring.- Refurbished: see warning below.- Moving parts: the 'retractable' feature is nice but one thing that I used to like about thumb drives was 'no moving parts' which gave me more peace of mind when trusting them with important data.- Annoyingly bright, orangey pulsating light: there's no way to turn it off.- Obsolete SanDisk's U3 Launchpad app pre-installed and not easy to remove.I will award this drive 5 stars mostly for the price (very low), its good I/O speed and for its storage capacity. It's not the 'perfect' USB drive - see the 'minuses' listed above but its good features are good enough to make me 'love it' which is Amazon's standard for 5 stars._____________________________________NOTES:The drive comes with SanDisk's U3 Launchpad installed. This is an 'old' technology meant to facilitate the launching of Windows apps of a flash drive. It allowed U3-compliant apps to temporarily write to your computer's registry... probably not a well-thought method. SanDisk considers U3 'dead' at this time but you are likely to find the 'Launchpad' on the USB drive. The best way to completely remove it is via a SanDisk-supplied tool - I will post a comment with the URL. Once that is done, Windows 7 allowed me to format the drive as either FAT32, NTFS or exFAT.Using a 'refurbished' USB drive with 'moving parts' to store/back up important data may not be a good idea. In my view, the drive is reasonably 'safe' but I'm only using it to transfer large media files from one computer to a media hub because transfer over USB is faster than transfer over Wi-Fi. I am not currently planning to store on it anything that's not backed up elsewhere, long term._____________________________________","[0, 0]","Dirt cheap, speedy, large storage, physically small",2011,03, 4,,2858,482,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20110304

The cable came in a little Amazon 'frustration free' box... inside a much larger box. There was nothing but the cable in the little box and a sticker on it states '5-Year Warranty'. My suggestion - if the cable does not work, send it back to Amazon immediately. They are the best when it comes to customer support. MicraDIGITAL does not seem to have any.Still in the 'not-so-clear' section, couldn't establish whether this was an HDMI 1.3 or 1.4 cable. There are no markings/designations on the cable itself and, like I said, I couldn't find any documentation in the box. Assuming that it's a High-Speed HDMI 1.3 wire, it should work well with practically any equipment one owns these days, up to and including Blu-ray 3D. I attempted to clarify this cable's type but the company site does not list any HDMI cables among their products. I tried to contact MicraDIGITAL via an email sent through their 'Customer Support' tab but the site returned an error when I pressed the 'send' button. Several times.My using this cable returned no negatives. It behaved no better and no worse than any other HDMI wire whether v1.3 or v1.4. This is not surprising because at lengths of 6 ft. there is very little signal attenuation on an HDMI cable and the digital equipment at the receiving end should have no problems properly interpreting it.My verdict is that this is a good HDMI 1.3 cable but I am a little puzzled and disappointed by the maker's failure to properly mark or identify it as an HDMI High-Speed 1.3 or 1.4 or clarifying what exactly '5-Year Warranty' meant. If 'looks' and the 'braided' feature are important, spending a couple of extra dollars may be worth it or a cheap-looking cable that does the exact same job could be had for less. Giving this cable credit for looks but removing a few for price, apparent lack of customer support and the vague cable type designation and warranty information, a 3-star rating should be 'fair'. According to Amazon's guidelines 3 stars mean 'It's Okay', which this cable is but it has nothing to make me 'like it' (4 stars) or 'love it' (5 stars).________________________________________Here are the HDMI 1.3 specs supported by all 'high speed' certified HDMI 1.4 cables regardless of brand, looks or braidingMaximum signal bandwidth (MHz) 340Maximum TMDS bandwidth (Gbit/s) 10.2Maximum video bandwidth (Gbit/s) 8.16Maximum audio bandwidth (Mbit/s) 36.86Maximum Color Depth (bit/px) 48Maximum resolution over single link at 24-bit/px  25601600p75Maximum resolution over single link at 30-bit/px  25601600p60Maximum resolution over single link at 36-bit/px  1920x1200p75Maximum resolution over single link at 48-bit/px  19201200p60sRGBYCbCr8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio capabilityBlu-ray Disc video and audio at full resolutionConsumer Electronic Control (CEC)DVD-Audio supportSuper Audio CD (DSD) supportDeep ColorxvYCCAuto lip-syncDolby TrueHD bitstream capableDTS-HD Master Audio bitstream capableUpdated list of CEC commands (only on HDMI 1.3a,b,c)________________________________________-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[0, 0]","Okay HDMI 1.3 cable, possibly 1.4",2011,02, 1,,3261,504,Neutral,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20110201

Anyone (such as myself) who currently relies on 'wireless' to connect various devices could use this  product or the more capable and expensiveBelkin F5D4081 VideoLink 3 Powerline Internet Adapteror the even more capableWestern Digital WD Livewire Powerline AV Network Kitfor networked appliances that either can't connect wirelessly (many Bluray players and TV sets) or are too far for a Wi-Fi connection to be practical.Before making a 'buy' decision, it is important to understand that adapters such as this one will NOT significantly improve 'Internet' performance unless your ISP provides you with a very large bandwidth. If your Wi-Fi router supports 802.11g, you will get an average throughput of 54 Mbit/s which is more than most ISP can provide for Internet bandwidth. 802.11n is even faster. In other words, your Wi-Fi router should usually handle whatever the Internet may throw at you with some room to spare and whether you get your ISP's 10 Mbit/s data stream over at 22 Mbit/s from Wi-Fi or at 200 Mbit/s from Livewire Powerline it's still... 10 Mbit/s or close. On the other hand, streaming form your media server at should make all the difference in the world when compared with your Wi-Fi throughput.WHO NEEDS IT?To summarize, you will BENEFIT from Belkin's product when:- You stream from YOUR media server- Have some Internet-ready device that does not support Wi-Fi and your home is not wired for Ethernet- You have a big house or for whatever reason Wi-Fi can't reach some specific device or the reception is poor- You have a VERY HIGH bandwidth Internet connectionYou will NOT BENEFIT from Belkin's Videolink or any other powerline adapter if you connect to the Internet via a 'normal' broadband link or if your house is already wired for Ethernet.MY EXPERIENCETo evaluate Belkin's VideoLink performance I submitted it to the exact same tests I performed on my older and trusted Western Digital adapter I've been using for more than a year now. I therefore tried it without reading the manual (a .pdf on CD). I was able to set it all up and get it running in a few minutes but not before I first obtained a pair of Ethernet patch cable because the 3-footers supplied by Belkin's were too short.In the box you find the twin VideoLink boxes, and two short (too short) Ethernet wires. And... yes a CD that should have a manual and maybe some software but I had no need for those yet. The boxes have 1 (ONE) RJ-45 (not phone jacks) port each and a security button you use when adding additional adapters. There are also lights that blink when you have 'power', when data flows and when you have an Ethernet link. The data port blinks 'green' when you get over 80Mbps and orange when the speed is lower than that.My setup and installation proceeded as follows:- I plugged each of the 2 adapters on a power outlet (must NOT plug it into a power strip or surge protector, it MUST go directly into the wall outlet).- On each of the 2 boxes I connected one end of the Ethernet wires to the one port on the box- I placed one of the boxes near my router in the basement and connected the other end of the Ethernet wire to one of the router's ports- I attached the Ethernet wire of the other box to my laptop upstairsOnce the above was done I turned off my laptop's Wi-Fi and I was pleased to see that data was still flowing AND that the pre-existing VPN connection reestablished itself over the power line.VIDEOLINK vs. VIDEOLINK 3 vs. WD LIVEWIRE- SETUP: it's a tie. The advantage that the VideoLink products get for plugging directly into the power outlet (no power cord) is erased by the fact that power cords add 'range', especially when the VideoLink products come with a 3-foot patch cable, usually not enough for most practical uses. WD's patch cables were equally short but, thanks to the power cables you CAN reach to something located 6 ft. away.- EASE OF USE: possibly a slight advantage to the VideoLink units for providing a 2-color data speed indicator. Other than that, they are both 'plug in and forget' for as long as you only use two. It gets a little more complicated when adding additional adapters but the process is explained fairly well in Belkin's one-page quick setup guide. Again, revisiting the patch cable issue, 3-foot Ethernet cables are too short. Belkin and WD should have provided longer cables.- RELIABILITY: not sufficient data. I've been using WD's LiveWire for about 14 months and never had an issue. In fact I rarely remember that they exist. I haven't used Belkin's product for long enough to make a comparison but Belkin's adapters appear to be well built and should be long-lived.- PERFORMANCE: WD wins. I give Belkin credit for explaining in the fine print that 200Mbps is the THEORETICAL highest possible speed you can get in a perfect world but you are never going to get it. I was able to get the 'above 80Mbps green light with the adapter attached to the router in the basement and my laptop on the first floor. On the second floor the speed dropped below 80Mbps. WD's adapter performed in the same way.The other dimension of 'performance' and that's where WD wins is WD providing 4 ports on each unit. That should allow you to attach up to seven networked devices with up to 4 of them attached to the remote box. VideoLink has only ONE port while VideoLink 3 comes with 3 ports.- PRICE: VideoLink wins but at the expense of 'performance' (see above). You may need a power line connection for only one device today but the odds are that your needs may change in the future. I'd personally spend a little extra and get either the VideoLink 3 or WD's LiveWire. I already have 3 networked devices at my entertainment center and that's 2 more that I had one year ago when I first set up the LiveWire.MY EVALUATIONAs far as I am concerned (see my experience notes above) Belkin's product does its magic well but it is limited by its one-port design. Yes, it costs a few dollars less but if you expect any future expansion, go with the VideoLink 3 (3 ports) or WD's product (4 ports).Three stars mean ""it's Okay"". It's a good product but only if one's needs are limited to ONE network device for the foreseeable future. For everybody else, it's the multiple-ports alternatives.","[0, 0]",Good but limited,2011,09, 30,,6451,1128,Neutral,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20110930

Kid has been happy as a clam ever since - he's the one who, given the limited budget, opted for a PC rather than a more elegant but less powerful laptop that a similar amount of money would have bought. He's rating it as 'a nine' on a 1 to 10 scale and it's a 9 because 'nothing deserves a 10' in his view. And this is why:* Performance for the price - I seriously doubt you can get anything faster for the money we paid. The 4-core AMD Phenom II plus 12GB or RAM plus a not too shabby Nvidia 550 GTX for graphics make this handle everything with ease and grace. My kid is currently playing Diablo 3 at max res and max frame rate with a bunch of other things such as Skype running at the same time and everything is as responsive as when playing Solitaire. I have little doubt that you can buy faster computers if you paid more but I also have little doubt that this box can handle anything 'gaming' in existence today and probably anything likely to emerge in the next couple of years.* Features - I already mentioned the CPU, 12 GB of RAM which is more than what you normally get installed and graphics but add to that: built-in Wi-Fi (most off the shelf gaming computers in this price range don't have one), USB 3.0 ports, 1 TB or disk space. Oh, I almost forgot, the graphics card supports HDMI output (nice) besides VGA and DVI.* Windows 7 - it screams on this box. Everything loads quickly and in the 2 weeks we've been using Microtel's machine... no crashes. I'm impressed.* No crapware/bloatware. Unlike most off-the-shelf laptops/PCs, this one came with near-zero useless 'free trial' antivirus, money management and whatever stuff preloaded. I believe there was exactly ONE app we had to remove. Everything else was there for a reason and I don't believe there are any free trial things that pop op twice a day reminding you that you're not a paying customer yet. There is stuff preloaded but it's 'good stuff'. Google Chrome, for example is loaded, some utility that does overclocking, Steam.* 10-minute setup. We got everything running in about 10 minutes. The box comes with its own keyboard mouse but we never used them. We used our own wireless alternatives and they were recognized as the computer booted up for the first time, didn't have to do anything to configure them. Same goes for the monitor. We plugged it with the included DVI cable and all came up at the monitor's maximum res, again, no question asked. The setup consisted of plugging in the monitor and the power cord, attaching the TWO Wi-Fi antennas, pushing the ON button and setting up an account. That was it.Of course, not everything is perfect but the 'not so good' parts aren't big enough to justify anything less than a 5-star rating. Worth stating that the box looks a little 'cheap' but, given what we paid for this, I was expecting that. Besides, it sits under the desk so who cares what it looks like? A more serious concern is the HDD I/O speed. It's a little slow (it's not actually 'slow', only slower than expected) but with 12GB of RAM, I don't foresee any issues whatsoever. I can't think of anything else that I could list as a negative.To conclude, my kid and I are extremely happy with our purchase. Our money bought as a powerful (for year 2012) gaming box with more features (extra memory, built-in Wi-Fi, good video card) than what you'd normally get even if you paid a few hundred more. Knowing what I know today, if I thought about buying another gaming box, I'd go with these guys again.By the way, one of my coworkers builds his own gaming PCs and he's built quite a few for his friends too. Before placing the order he looked at the specs and he told me that he wouldn't be able to build a box with similar features for a lot less. And if you factor in 'free shipping', you get to pay just about what you would, plus-minus a few dollars if you built the machine yourself.","[8, 9]",Major bang,2012,06, 12,0.8888888888888888,3990,730,Positive,8,9,1,0.022634750040709983,20120612

And I like it in spite of it lacking a few almost 'must have' features for a device in its class such as some storage redundancy (RAID-1 = disk mirroring) or at least a built-in backup utility or any significant security or, to a lesser extent (I'll explain) built-in Wi-Fi. And I like it even though bugs still exist such as the Hub's occasional failure to maintain/update its 'media library'. And I do like it even though the Hub's supported Web 'services' are few at this time - because some of the 'major' ones are there.___________________________Note: (9/9/2011 update):I am upgrading this to 5-stars because since the original writing of my review most of the bugs have been addressed and many important Web services and other features such as 'games' were added.Because of its versatility, built-in storage, low power consumption and its ability to integrate with everything else the Hub is now the centerpiece (the true hub)of my entertainment center.___________________________WHY I LIKE ITSome of the shortcomings duly noted above, I like the Hub because:The Hub turns out to be a well connected, relatively easy to use and operate, low-power, physically small, versatile video/music/still photos player with the built in ability to store the equivalent of almost 200 DVD-quality movies on its built-in 1TB drive, expandable to many times more than that via an attached USB drive and capable to sync and play content from any accessible media server such as PCs, Xboxes or PS3s, Microsoft Home Servers or NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices.The Hub can also go out on the Net and report the local weather, play YouTube videos, Netflix, Hulu Plus and Blockbuster movies, Podcasts and Pandora music (I compiled a list of supported Web services below).I was able to add the TV Live Hub to my Harmony universal remote control setup and I was able to address the lack of built-in backup (running a scheduled Robocopy task off a Home Server) because the Hub's drive can be mapped and managed as any other computer drive through a PC.The Hub plays content off existing media servers and it acts as a media server for other devices (PCs, PS3s, etc.) on the same network. It can be set to sync with whatever content it can discover on your home network and it supports iTunes (did not test iTunes support myself). And for the hard-core YouTube users, a USB-attached keyboard should allow for easy searching. Also, the Hub makes it easy to post content directly to Facebook and Flickr.And, finally, the Hub is likely to do more and do it better tomorrow because WD is constantly updating the firmware and hopefully it will address some of the more annoying bugs soon and because there appears to be an active, lively, innovative, helpful and supportive user community. [Note: 2 firmware updates later, several new Web services were added and some bugs were fixed.]________________________________________________________________Here are the hub's features in a more organized format.MEDIA PLAYER- Plays videos with full support for HD and multi-channel sound.- Plays music with support for playlists.- Plays movies/videos with filters for genre, rating and so on.- Displays photos, has slideshow capabilities.- Games section (added on 5/17/2011) has 'mind games' such as Sudoku, puzzles, memory games.MEDIA HUB- Acts as a media server for other devices (PCs, PS3s, Xboxes). My PS3 'saw' the Hub and was able to play content off it as soon as it went online.- Plays content from other media servers on the local network. It saw 'everything' we were sharing as soon as we turned it on.- Plays content off NAS (Network Attached Storage).- Syncs with media found on PCs and has support for iTunes.ONLINE SERVICES- Services availability is controlled by WD. As far as I know, you can't add or remove a service but that may change in the future.- Current selection is limited but 'big names' are supported: Netflix, Blockbuster, YouTube, Pandora, Flickr, Facebook, etc.- Grabs metadata (title, description, cover graphics) for music and movies.- Firmware is upgraded by WD remotely.CUSTOMIZATION- Users can download or create their own themes and backgrounds.- Integrates with Harmony remotes.- Several styles of menus.- Additional storage can be attached directly through USB port(s).- Supports USB keyboards.- Supports certain Wi-Fi USB-connected devices (not tested by me).SPECS- I/O ports: Optical, HDMI, Composite, RCA, 2 USB, gigabit Ethernet- Video (Full HD 1920x1080): AVI (Xvid, AVC, MPEG1/2/4), M2TS, MKV (h.264, x.264, AVC, MPEG1/2/4, VC-1), MP4/MOV (MPEG4, h.264), MPG/MPEG, TS/TP/M2T (MPEG1/2/4, AVC, VC-1), VOB, WMV9- Audio: (multichannel up to 7.1) AAC, AIF/AIFF, Dolby Digital, DTS, FLAC, MKA, MP3, OGG, WAV/PCM/LPCM, WMA,- Photo: BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIF/TIFF________________________________________________________________MY EXPERIENCE: SETUPIt was as easy as plugging in the unit, connecting to a network hub with an Ethernet cable (not supplied) and to a receiver through an HDMI (not supplied either) cable.HDMI 1.4 is supported but composite (RCA), and component outputs are also available as well as an S/PDIF digital (optical) output. For best results, 'wired' network connectivity should be preferred. It's the only one supported out of the box and, if you expect to play or stream HD content, it's the only one that can support the load reliably.Once the box is turned on it quickly updates itself and it's ready to use. Literally 5-10 minutes after powerup we were watching YouTube videos. Of course, additional setup is needed to fully customize it but the Hub can make itself useful quickly and there's no need to rush. Some of the Web services such as Pandora or Netflix require that you have an account but the Hub makes it easy to set yourself up if you don't have one. On the local network, as I mentioned already, the Hub became immediately visible and it was able to see and use the other active media servers running. From a PC it's easy to connect the Hub's drive and upload content. It's also the only way you can back it up.MY EXPERIENCE: OPERATIONI've been using the hub to store and play DVD and Netflix movies and occasionally music. I've already uploaded several thousand photos, home videos, backed up lots of DVD movies and TV shows and some 700 songs and there's plenty of room for more. Video play off the local disk or from a Microsoft Home server we keep on our network was flawless. I prefer the Hub to PS3 playback because, the Hub lacking big fans, there is no audible 'hum' during playback. Music playing is okay, both off the disk or off Pandora and so are the photo slideshows. Some of the 'radio' and other content services don't look/sound so good but, since I've experience flawless HD playback on Netflix and music on Pandora, I'm blaming 'them' for the low quality.As far as the other Web services, I don't have major complaints but it's annoying that YouTube recognizes the Hub as something that's attached to a TV and will NOT let you to see anything that's 'big media' produced. Netflix is okay and the latest firmware upgrade brought in the same great interface (Netflix 3.0?) I have on the PS3.The Hub can make media watching and organizing as easy or as complicated as you are prepared to allow it. It has the ability to consolidate everything it sees on its local storage and on the network around it into a big pile of 'stuff' and the 'media library' will then show you all sci-fi movies you have (an example) regardless of where they are. Or, if you want things arranged in a certain way, you can create your own folders, name them any way you want and navigate to your favorite movies/shows yourself.From a PC you can easily stream music off the Hub but, because all the movies I keep on it are at the highest resolution, DVD movies streaming can be a little jittery over Wi-Fi and HD doesn't work at all. The Hub works best when playing off its own disk or accessing/serving content over 'fast' wired connections. My home is not wired for Ethernet but I'm using aWestern Digital WD Livewire Powerline AV Network Kitto pipe Ethernet over the power lines. It works.I should also mention that the online manual is VERY well written, very well organized and very helpful. It comes with links to other online resources, including the very active Hub community board where you can find a lot of good advice concerning enhancements and bugs.BUGSOn 'day one' after uploading some 5000 photos, a message informed me that the Hub was compiling its media library. It was still compiling on 'day two' and it didn't stop until I told the Hub to drop the library and then rebuild it. Rebuilding the library can take 10-15 minutes but it's annoying and I hope that the next firmware update will take care of it. Meanwhile, I learned to be careful as in ""don't try to do something else while the media library is being rebuilt"" and I only had once similar incident in the past month. I'm not sure whether this was because of the firmware updates or because I'm more 'gentle' when interacting with the Hub.Another bug seems to be the 'queue'. You have the ability to drop movies or songs into a queue to play them later but it does not always work that way, the Hub reporting that the content couldn't be found. I'm not using the queue feature any longer because it sometimes seems to trigger the never-ending media library recompilation (see above).I can't think of any other significant bugs other than the Hub rebooting itself a couple of times.On the WD discussion board I learned that quite a few users had issues with the power button. Apparently it can cause the Hub to constantly reboot, making it unusable. I haven't experienced this problem but I never physically 'touch' the Hub except to dust it off. All operations can be done remotely and, since I've read about that problem, I am somewhat reluctant to physically interact with the Hub.EVALUATIONI already announced in the first paragraph that this is a '4 stars' to me because 'I like it' and it's not a '5 stars' because I don't love it yet: bugs, not a lot of Web services. My PS3 does almost everything that the Hub does and some of it it does better AND it plays movies and music off discs and it plays games but I can't afford to keep my PS3 always on because it burns a lot of electricity and its fans aren't silent and you can't have 1TB worth of storage on it. The PS3 can also cost $100-200 more. In other words, the Hub has its place and even with a sophisticated machine such as a PS3 or a Microsoft Home server around it's going to see its share of use and playtime. I see how the consecutive firmware upgrades are making the Hub an increasingly versatile device and I won't be surprised if the bugs are addressed and more functionality becomes available._________________________________NOTE:The latest firmware upgrades added a number of great Web services and the new additions have enough depth to satisfy me. This is what was available at the time I wrote this:- AccuWeather- Blockbuster- CinemaNow- DEEZER- facebook- flickr- flingo- Hulu Plus- LIVE 365- Mefdiafly- NETFLIX- PANDORA- Picasa- tunein- SHOUTcast- YouTubeNOTE - March 25, 2011I tried a 'stress test' the other day.

My sample also included Mother (Pink Floyd), S&M; (Rihanna), Hotel California (The Eagles), Vodoo Chile (Stevie Ray Vaughan), Americano (Lady Gaga), Crash (Gwen Stefani) and so forth.As I already stated in the first paragraph, there were no negatives. Yes, the bass is featured more prominently but not at the expense of the higher frequencies. The delivery of Colbie Caillat's delicate nuances approaches the quality of the much higher end over the ear headphones while anything 'hip hop' can be nothing short of brain-shattering if you let it be that way (kids, don't push the volume too high because while you can always replace your headphones, you're stuck with the same pair of ears for the rest of your life).I had a time-limited test session in mind but once I was completed the test tracks on my list I simply couldn't stop. I ended up listening for over 2 hours and it took a lot of will power to take them off because they sound so good.DESIGN AND ERGONOMICS (5 stars)This is a cool looking pair of headphones and my 15 yr. old kid (who'll end up using them) agrees. I have the black version with red accents and red cord and they look good. And, just in case someone may confuse them with some other brand, Fannie Wang's signature appears in about half a dozen places - not an easy feat given that we are talking about a pair of headphones here.They are quite comfortable too. The headphones are light and even on a big head such as mine, they extend to fully cover my ears and block most of outside noise. When not in use, they fold nicely for storage. The red cord allows for sharing your music with a friend featuring a port for them to plug in their headphones.EVERYTHING ELSE (2 stars)It's a shame and inexcusable that a pair of headphones this good comes with such a cheap-looking, low quality storage bag. Besides it offering zero protection, the way the soft fabric is stitched together it almost guarantees that the bag won't last long if actually used. And it being white will turn it into a dirty-looking bag in no time.The warranty is a bit confusing. While the manual claims a 2-year warranty, the official warranty statement repeatedly mentions 2... months. I suspect it's a mistake and the warranty is indeed '2 years' but it's  confusing. I hope that the warranty statement is re-written.MY OVERALL RATING (4 stars)The Fannie Wangs are high quality, well built, easy to wear, good looking headphones. They would be an easy 5-star if it weren't for the terrible bag - and at THIS price point a decent, usable storage/protective case is expected - and the confusing warranty wording.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[3, 3]","Killing Me Softly (Boom, Boom, Pow!!!)",2011,07, 5,1.0,3585,609,Positive,3,3,0,0.022504478098029638,20110705

It offers a number of outstanding features and, yes, one major disappointment.I will begin with the 'bad' because it's an irritant. The quality of this TomTom's display is NOT good. Can live with it but for something that's supposed to be 'the latest and greatest' it could be better. Another unit we used currently and we bought back in 2007 or 2008 comes with a better display. The 5-inch screen features relatively low resolution and what seems to be a graphics engine capable of displaying only a few colors. The 3-D map mode is plagued by color bands. The low resolution drastically limits the level of details and the amount of information that can be displayed on the screen at any given time. As I noted before, the 3-D map mode which is my favorite on my other 2 GPS units I am currently using - an old Garmin and aSony NVU83T 4.8-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator- is so bad, I won't use it on the TomTom.And it's a shame because the this is a great GPS in so many ways. Here are what I consider to be this unit's great to outstanding features:- Good navigation engine. Of my 3 GPS units, TomTom's appears to be the better one. So far, TomTom was able to ALMOST always find the best (quickest or shortest) route. Whenever I strayed off the recommended track, TomTom quickly adapted to the new reality and recalculated a new route rather than repeatedly trying to steer me back to the old one as my other GPS units usually do.- Free maps, of course. Nothing beats 'free' and updates can be easily obtained at TomTom's site by simply connecting the unit to a computer via a supplied proprietary cable that plugs into computer's USB port.- Free traffic. And it's not the 'usual' 3-month free trial. This 'traffic' is truly free. No registration is required. For as long as the unit is plugged into the car's charger the special connecting cable has a built-in FM receiver that grabs traffic information and should alert you of any delays. In practice, 'traffic' is more of a gimmick at this time and TomTom is right to give up attempts to charge for it. I found myself stuck in a traffic jam on MAJOR US highway while TomTom reported 'all-clear' and there were instances when TomTom, based on the traffic information it got off the air, kept telling me that I was in a terrible traffic situation while I was zipping through at 70 mph. In a few words, 'traffic' is pretty good with 'construction', not so good with traffic jams due to sun glare or accidents. When issues are detected, TomTom offers alternative routes and estimates delays.- The ability to use ZIP codes for US destinations. It's possible that other GPS brands do ZIP codes but my old Garmin and the newer Sony don't and that was always a big frustration for me.- Voice commands. The features above were 'outstanding'. Voice control is 'good to great'. You can say things such as 'take me home' and TomTom will interpret the command correctly, most of the time. Still... having to touch the screen before saying something half-defeats the concept of 'voice' control.Of course, there are many other features that we now expect in a GPS. They are well implemented and some worth mentioning include:- Bluetooth integration. You can pair TomTom with your phone and use it as a speaker.- Touch screen.- Navigate to 'points of interest' including unexpected ones such as 'the nearest dentist' or physician.- Displays vehicle's speed, road's speed limit and even a graphic warning when you go 5-7 miles over the speed limit.- Displays time and expected arrival time and 'how long' before you reach destination.- Lane assist graphically shows on which lane you should be before taking a turn or an exit.- 2D/3D maps - like I said, the 3D look terrible.- Display brightness automatically adjusts for day/night.As for features that other GPS have and TomTom doesn't:- No security. My Sony comes with optional password protection. It doesn't make the GPS unusable if you forget the password but it WILL erase everything before allowing someone else in. This is very important if your GPS is stolen because you don't want the thief to get directions to where you live. It could be argued that the ease of taking the unit out of the mount mitigates the lack of password protection but I'd prefer an electronic lock's permanent peace of mind.- My old Garmin would turn itself on automatically when the car charger supplied power and turn itself off when it didn't unless I specifically agreed that it should continue on battery. This eliminated the need to turn the GPS on/off all the time. The TomTom doesn't.- My Sony GPS made it very easy for me to organize my 'favorites' into many separate folders. By comparison, TomTom's handling of 'favorites' is not as good.- Also the Sony came with a 'motion detection' capability where it would estimate your vehicle's position even when satellite contact was lost - inside a garage or in a tunnel. TomTom does not seem to have that.- TomTom does not display a compass. It's no big deal but sometimes you do want to know whether you are heading due North or West.My rating is a 3 stars plus. The terrible low-resolution, few-colors display and the lack of password protection lower this unit's rating from 'excellent' down to 'good'.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[1, 1]",Good but not quite best in class,2011,08, 12,1.0,5382,938,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20110812

As I noted before, the 3-D map mode which is my favorite on my other 2 GPS units I am currently using - an old Garmin and aSony NVU83T 4.8-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator- is so bad, I won't use it on the TomTom.And it's a shame because the this is a great GPS in so many ways. Here are what I consider to be this unit's great to outstanding features:- Good navigation engine. Of my 3 GPS units, TomTom's appears to be the better one. So far, TomTom was able to ALMOST always find the best (quickest or shortest) route. Whenever I strayed off the recommended track, TomTom quickly adapted to the new reality and recalculated a new route rather than repeatedly trying to steer me back to the old one as my other GPS units usually do.- Free maps, of course. Nothing beats 'free' and updates can be easily obtained at TomTom's site by simply connecting the unit to a computer via a supplied proprietary cable that plugs into computer's USB port.- The ability to use ZIP codes for US destinations. It's possible that other GPS brands do ZIP codes but my old Garmin and the newer Sony don't and that was always a big frustration for me.- Voice commands. The features above were 'outstanding'. Voice control is 'good to great'. You can say things such as 'take me home' and TomTom will interpret the command correctly, most of the time. Still... having to touch the screen before saying something half-defeats the concept of 'voice' control.Of course, there are many other features that we now expect in a GPS. They are well implemented and some worth mentioning include:- Touch screen.- Navigate to 'points of interest' including unexpected ones such as 'the nearest dentist' or physician.- Displays vehicle's speed, road's speed limit and even a visual warning (red) when you go 5-7 miles over the speed limit.- Displays time and expected arrival time and 'how long' before you reach destination.- Lane assist graphically shows on which lane you should be before taking a turn or an exit.- 2D/3D maps - like I said, the 3D look terrible.- Display brightness automatically adjusts for day/night.As for features that other GPS have and TomTom doesn't:- No security. My Sony comes with optional password protection. It doesn't make the GPS unusable if you forget the password but it WILL erase everything before allowing someone else in. This is very important if your GPS is stolen because you don't want the thief to get directions to where you live. It could be argued that the ease of taking the unit out of the mount mitigates the lack of password protection but I'd prefer an electronic lock's permanent peace of mind.- My Sony GPS made it very easy for me to organize my 'favorites' into many separate folders. By comparison, TomTom's handling of 'favorites' is not as good.- Also the Sony came with a 'motion detection' capability where it would estimate your vehicle's position even when satellite contact was lost - inside a garage or in a tunnel. TomTom does not seem to have that.- TomTom does not display a compass. It's no big deal but sometimes you do want to know whether you are heading due North or West.My rating is a 3 stars. The terrible low-resolution, few-colors display, the lack of traffic (can get it in the TM model) and the lack of password protection lower this unit's rating from 'excellent' down to 'good'.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[0, 0]",Good but could be better,2011,08, 30,,4181,732,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20110830

One of its ends is a 'mini' (Type C) connector that may be required by certain cameras such as the Flip MinoHD but is not compatible with 'regular' equipment. And do NOT confuse the 'mini' with the 'micro' (Type D) HDMI connector which is even smaller and works with the newest/smallest gadgets. Check your gadget's manual before you place your order.B - You don't mind the 'premium price'. If you search Amazon for 'HDMI mini' you will find quite a few similar items and it should be up to you to decide which one to order based on published specs, shipping charges, price, looks and reviews.And, talking about specs, this cable is a 'High Speed' rated HDMI 1.4 cable 'with Ethernet'.- The 'High Speed' rating is largely meaningless, indicating that the cable supports 1080p video - almost all do and no one should ever consider buying anything less.- The 'with Ethernet' badge indicates that, if the 2 connected devices support Ethernet AND support HDMI 1.4, they will be able to use the HDMI cable for Ethernet traffic instead of requiring a separate additional phone-like wire. Of course, none of the small cameras that would use a mini HDMI connector talk 'Ethernet' so this 'with Ethernet' feature doesn't really matter much.- 6 ft. length is just about right. The cable is long enough to allow for a connection to the back of your TV or receiver while the 'mini' end can be pulled to the front where your camera would plug.- Black - the cable that I received was not the nice grey seen in Amazon's page picture but an industrial black. Given that this is a visible HDMI cable, not something that goes to the back of your entertainment center, the grey would have been better and the 'mini' end of the cable could have had a nicer design.I had no trouble to plug the mini end into my MinoHD and the regular into a TV and play video directly. Playback was flawless and, even though this is not something that everyone needs or anyone needs often, it doesn't hurt having one around.I am granting this cable 4 stars because I can't find no faults to it other than the somewhat high price and the looks that do not suggest 'high end' or 'premium'.","[0, 0]",HDMI good if...,2011,04, 2,,2220,400,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20110402

The bag does look marvelous, no question about it and it does look a lot better than the average laptop bag. It's also a pain to use because it has a major design flaw.THE BADIt's probably fair to start with the bad part because if the the shoulder strap being always in the way whenever trying to get things in or out of the bag is a problem then there's not need to waste time reading about specs or the other good features.The problem is that the wide, non-removable shoulder strap does not use D-rings or any kind of ring to connect itself to the bag's body. It always stands up on top of the bag's opening and that makes it very difficult to get it out of the way when trying to get things in and out. You must constantly move it out of the way and it keeps coming back - annoying. Amazon's photos should give you a pretty good ideas of what to expect.THE GOODSThe well-protected and generously padded inner compartment can easily host a 14-15"" laptop. The main compartment has 2 large partitions, one for the laptop and the second with several zippered mesh pockets, detachable little purses, pen holders and so on. Two large side pockets off which one is zippered allow for even more versatility. And, when a little more room is needed, the zippered extension option allows for the bag to expand an extra 1.5"" thicker, accordion-style.Listing some of the features/specs:- Shoulder-bag only- 9 pockets/partitions by my count- 4 zippered compartments- Expandable to up to 1.5"" thicker- Good padding for a laptop/netbook/tablet- Security strap lets you anchor the bag around a stool leg (watch for dogs if at an outdoor cafe)- 16 x 2.5 x 13.8"" external dimensions- 13 x 1.1 x 9.1"" internal dimensions- Made in ChinaI recognize the bag's versatility - many pockets - and the ability to expand it. I also liked the quality of materials and the generously wide shoulder strap. And the bag does look pretty.MY RATINGIn spite of all the good things I mentioned above, I hesitate between a one star (I hate it) and a two stars (I don't like it) rating because the shoulder strap interference with just about everything you do with the bag is THAT annoying. Sadly, the opposite of what seems to be the Case Logic motto: ""Life, Simplified."" applies in this case. The Pavonis is likely to complicate your life but it will probably make you look good.

The good speed rating should make it acceptable to use with compatible cameras and camcorders.The card gets 2 stars because the price is not exactly a bargain and because 4GB is really small in this day and age. The speed rating and the excellent Amazon service for the AmazonBasics line (easy to return, warranty service) are pluses.Notes of Caution:- This is an SDHC (with the HC underlined) card. Which means that some older devices may not support it even if it fits into the slot. You are safe if your gadget specifically specifies support for SDHC (as opposed to SD only). If not, it could still work but it's a gamble.- Make sure that this is the correct physical size before you order. SDHC cards also come in 'mini' and 'micro' sizes. While the 'micro' cards are easy to recognize because they are VERY small, the 'regular' (24 mm wide) and the 'mini' (20 mm wide) can be easily confused.- In addition, some old cameras may not recognize memory above 2GB and will format the card to use 2GB only.- Amazon lumped together reviews for AmazonBasics SDHC cards of several capacities. Be aware the 4GB is the ONLY one that is 'class 10'.

For me, it fulfills the task assigned - stores a large number of songs for a little MP3 Player that accepts microSDHC cards. However, its relatively low data transfer speed may NOT make it a good pick if the intended use was in a camera that takes 'rapid fire' shots.PERFORMANCEI would like to note that I did not test the card with a camera but its stated 'Class 4' speed class, which is the equivalent of a 26x speed rating should guarantee a MINIMUM of 4MB/s - more than enough when it comes to music playback and non-HD videos.Unlike the 'x' ratings, the speed class ratings are NOT certified by an independent body so, more or less, you will have to decide whether you trust the card's maker. I found that I could copy 2 GB worth of songs in about 6-7 minutes. This is about 4-5MB/s for writing on the card for the first time, indicating that the Class 4/26x claim is honest. This is very good performance for a 'class 4' given that the card was inserted in the provided 'full' SDHC card adapter which, in turn, was inserted into a USB card reader.Practically, if you are going to use this card in a camera, depending on the quality of the pics you are taking, you may or may not be happy with its performance. At 12 megapixels, a 100% quality JPG would produce a 2-3 MB or loarger file so, without even counting the overhead, your camera will spend about half second, possibly more to write to the card which may or may not be in line with your own expectation. For better performance, look for a higher 'class' number 133x/Class 20, for example, should support 20 MB/s or writing up to 10 12-megapixel JPG photo files per second.ADDITIONAL FEATURES/CONCERNSThe card comes with a 'full' SDHC adapter. This is very important, especially if you need to interface with a computer. When I do that I insert the microSDHC into the included SDHC adapter which, in turn, goes into a USB card reader - I am using the one that came with the Transcend 16 GB Class 2 SDHC Flash Memory Card with USB Card Reader TS16GSDHC2-P2.The card comes formatted as FAT32 and my Windows 7 computer was able to write to it and read from it without difficulty. If, for whatever reason, FAT32 is not what you need, you should be able to format it under Windows/Vista, Mac or Unix/Linux to whatever you may need. The MP3 player was able to read the card as formatted without any issues.Related to the above - anyone who may have a device meant to use SD cards should be aware that SDHC may not work with it so it's better to ask the maker.While the SDHC interface is provided, I would go for a full-size SDHC card if that's what my gadget accepted. You can use the card with the adapter but why bother. The microSDHC being so small and fragile, why risk losing it or breaking it?WARRANTYThe lifetime warranty statement on the card (whose lifetime?) will have Transcend replace or repair your item if you still have your receipt and you don't do anything from a long list of activities and nothing  that's on a long list of possible happenings happens to the card (don't chew on it). In other words, it's meaningless.RATINGThis is a honestly rated Class 4 card. It works very well for me in my MP3 player but I'd look for a faster card if I needed a card for a camera or a camcorder. Class 4 means 'relatively SLOW' so, if blazing-fast write speed is not an issue, this is probably what you need given the price.One star is lost for the largely meaningless 'lifetime warranty' claim.","[0, 0]",Good value overall,2012,03, 23,,3597,654,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20120323

It's a VERY easy to set router that, based on my one-year experience with the E3200 is going to operate reliably and, as I mentioned above, even comes with a some interesting bells and whistles. However, some of the 'high performance' claims proved to be slightly exaggerated and I wasn't impressed by the quality of user support.SETUP (5 of 5)One question most of us ask ourselves before proceeding to set something as intimidating as a new router is 'will I be able to make it work for me?' The good news is that in this case the answer should be 'probably or most likely yes.' For a basic setup, you simply plug in the router, run the Cisco Connect app provided on a CD on a computer equipped with a Wi-Fi adapter and... you are connected. On the EA series you can even download an app that will allow you to manager your home network off an iOS or Android gadget.Cisco Connect is a well-organized app that will help you add devices to the network - and once the router is up and running most devices will add themselves once you provide the password - allow for limited 'guest' access on a separate network, set parental controls, test your Internet connection speed and directly manage your router if you need to split your network for better performance, configure DNS and DHCP, advanced wireless settings, security, manage the attached disk if you have one, set access policies and so forth.It gets as sophisticated as you need it to be and the good news is that both Cisco Connect and the router's Web interface are well organized and are backed by a very well written and quite detailed manual available online and I highly recommend getting it because it covers 'everything'.My basic setup completed in a couple of minutes and it took a couple of minutes more to register individual devices: laptops, desktops, printers, portable gaming devices, home servers, Internet radios, tablets, Kindles and my trusted Blackberry. Anything that has a wired connection (4 10/100/1000 Mpbs ports are available) does not need any setup. The more sophisticated tasks, such as reserving IP addresses for printers and a media hub and 'splitting' the traffic into 2 separately named networks mapping into the router's 2 frequency bands (2.4 MHz and 5 MHz) were equally easy and well covered by the manual.It's important that Cisco Connect is installed on one of your computers if not on all because the first thing it does when you start it is checking the router's status and attempting to fix whatever problems may be if it detects any. To get 'the latest' I installed it from Cisco's site and I didn't experience any issues during or after the install completed.PERFORMANCE AND RANGE (4 of 5)Depending on your clients, the router can provide as much as 300 Gbps + 450 Gbps on the 2 bands - this was a major improvement over the 802.11g router it's replacing. This is a lot considering that the best I am getting from my ISP is 15 Mbps downstream and 2 Mbps upstream but today's home networks have a lot of internal traffic if you use NAS devices, media servers or home servers that are set to run backups.While the router supports 802.11 a/b/g/n the manual warns that best performance can be achieved when all clients support 802.11n and that one single 802.11a client can slow the entire network if present.In practice I got consistent 150 Mbps on the 5 GHz band while in the same room at about 30 ft. from the router (except for a few minutes each day when the 5 GHz signal drops for no apparent reason (same behavior I observed on the older E3200). With one floor in-between, 90 Mbps was possible but the 5 GHz band wasn't as reliable or I could get a steady stream of 54 Mbps, sometimes better on the 2.4 GHz band. With 2 floors in between (router in the basement and my computer on the second floor and at the other end of the house, some 70-80 ft. away) the 5 MHz band became practically unusable and the 2.4 GHz band would get me 6-24 Mbps, still okay for Web browsing. The computers on the second floor right above the router get a steady 50-70 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. All the bandwidth issues were resolved when I added aLinksys RE1000 Wireless-N Range Extenderto the network at the cost of rare hiccups that may require unplugging 'everything', maybe every couple of weeks or so.I would like to note that, while the router broadcasting on 2 bands does have its advantages the 5 GHz signal works best when you have line of sight to the router or one thin wall/floor in between. It's not as good at passing through walls as the 2.4 GHz signal. It is possible to maximize performance by using a combination of wired plus 2 segregated bands but some testing and good planning is needed.RELIABILITY (4.5 of 5)The EA3500 has been remarkably stable so far (couple of weeks of use). It's fair to state that, when the default settings are kept, the router will automatically switch between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and between the available channels on each band to maximize performance and minimize interference. Since I don't have neighbors, I can't say how the router would perform in a more crowded environment.EXTRA FEATURES (4.5 of 5)The EA3500 is chuck-full of advanced features including strong security and encryption and the ability to optimize it for gaming (works fine as unoptimized for me so I didn't bother) and, of course, the most visible being the USB port through which you can share files off an attached disk with control over access level on the local network and over the Internet.On my features wish list... I wish it was possible to actually control the signal strength because the 5 GHz band is clearly underpowered. Also, while it is possible to remotely reboot the router, it would have been nice if a physical 'off' switch was available.WARRANTY AND SUPPORT (2 of 5)There is a 1 year more or less standard limited warranty. The full terms are posted at Cisco's site so I'm not going to go into details. My experience with routers - and this is my 4th or 5th wireless - is that, if they work, they last forever.The support... I can't say that I had a happy experience with my E3200 and a 'test' call for the EA3500 followed about the same pattern. Before I Googled for '5 GHz signal strength' I thought I'd ask a Cisco support person about it over a chat session. I also wanted to ask about the on and off loss of connection over the 5 GHz band. What followed was a long, sterile and at times absurd 58-minute chat session (Cisco did email me the time-stamped transcript) with an offshore person struggling with a script and asking me to perform meaningless activities instead of telling me that 'yes, the 5 GHz signal is weaker'. Eventually she did say that 'yes, the 5 GHz signal is weaker' but only after I asked the question several times. As for the occasional connection drop, I got the standard 'install the latest firmware update' even though she knew that I had the latest firmware version for the router (one of the first things she asked) and she knew that the router was set to automatically download and install firmware updates.I believe that my chat was part of the initial 90-day live free support that Cisco provides. In addition, of course, there are posted FAQs and discussion boards. Cisco also offers some 'paid' support but they don't say whether it's coming from offshore underpaid workers or from technicians who can actually help solve problems. My view is that the manual is so well written and the quality of the router is so high, not much support should be needed.MY RATINGI am VERY tempted to rate the EA3500 a five-star but the quality of human support and the over-hyping/marketing of the dual band capability (nice to have but not a quantum leap into super-high performance) are dragging down my rating into the 4 star territory. By the way, 4 stars means 'I like it' but not 'I love it'. Fact is, I almost love it because this is a very good product but... not perfect.This may not be the best n-router out there - Cisco does sell a higher-end models for a few dollars more - but I suspect it's all the way there at the top. I can't see how you can go wrong with this one._________________________________________Note: this is what the EA3500 has been dealing with in our household, so far almost without a glitch (range extender in place)- Attached HDD- PS3 (wired over power lines)- Media hub (wired over power lines)- NAS (wired)- 3 printers (all Wi-Fi from here on)- Range extender- 2 Internet radios- 3 laptops- PC- 2 Android Tablets- HP Touchpad Tablet- Kindle Fire (still a tablet)- 3 more Kindles- Blackberry- DSi- PSP- VitaI'm sure I missed a couple of devices but my point is that the EA3500 works well sometimes under extreme stress._________________________________________________Update July 3, 2013One star goes off for the horrible customer service. After spending over an hour, being moved back and forth from 'customer support' to 'tech support' and back, Cisco decided they would NOT sell me a replacement power adapter (original had been destroyed in an electrical storm) because my unit was out of warranty. This is NOT the way to keep your customers happy or keep your customers at all. Apparently, Cisco believes that, at least when it comes to 'home' products, their customers are on their own once the warranty expires.Way to go Cisco but, wherever you're going, I'm no longer with you.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[2, 2]",Routing Heaven Territory (downgraded for the horrible customer support experience),2012,05, 4,1.0,9725,1700,Negative,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20120504

Dent ""Aragorn""",1306972800,2.0,B004T9RR7C,"06 2, 2011","The Linksys E3200  is, without a doubt, an impressive product. It's one VERY easy to set router that appears to operate reliably and even comes with a couple of notable bells and whistles. However, some of the 'high performance' claims proved to be slightly exaggerated and I wasn't impressed by the quality of user support.SETUP (5 of 5)One question most of us ask ourselves before proceeding to set something as intimidating as a new router is 'will I be able to make it work for me?' The good news is that in this case the answer should be 'probably or most likely yes.' For a basic setup, you simply plug in the router, run the Cisco Connect app provided on a CD on a computer equipped with a Wi-Fi adapter and... you are connected.Cisco Connect is a well-organized app that will help you add devices to the network - and once the router is app and running most devices will add themselves once you provide the password - allow for limited 'guest' access on a separate network, set parental controls, test your Internet connection speed and directly manage your router if you need to split your network for better performance, configure DNS and DHCP, advanced wireless settings, security, manage the attached disk if you have one, set access policies and so forth.It gets as sophisticated as you need it to be and the good news is that both Cisco Connect and the router's Web interface are are well organized and are backed by a very well written and quite detailed manual. I will post the link to the downloadable PDF as a comment to this review.My basic setup completed in a couple of minutes and it took a couple of minutes more to register individual devices: laptops, desktops, printers, portable gaming devices, home servers, Internet radio. Anything that has a wired connection (4 10/100/1000 Mpbs ports are available) does not need any setup. The more sophisticated tasks, such as reserving IP addresses for printers and a media hub and 'splitting' the traffic into 2 separately named networks mapping into the router's 2 frequency bands (2.4 MHz and 5 MHz) were equally easy and well covered by the manual.It's important that Cisco Connect is installed on one of your computers if not on all because the first thing it does when you start it is checking the router's status and attempting to fix whatever problems if it detects any. To get 'the latest' I installed it from Cisco's site and I didn't experience any issues during or after the install completed.PERFORMANCE AND RANGE (4 of 5)Depending on your clients, the router can provide as much as 2 x 300 Gbps - this was a major improvement over the 802.11g router it's replacing. This is a lot considering that the best I am getting from my ISP is 15 Mbps downstream and 2 Mbps upstream but today's home networks have a lot of internal traffic if you use NAS devices, media servers or home servers that are set to run backups.While the router supports 802.11 a/b/g/n the manual warns that best performance can be achieved when all clients support 802.11n and that one single 802.11a client can slow the entire network if present.In practice I got consistent 150 Mbps on the 5 GHz band while in the same room at about 30 ft. from the router (except for a few minutes each day when the 5 GHz signal drops for no apparent reason - see the posted screenshots). With one floor in-between, 90 Mbps was possible but the 5 GHz band wasn't as reliable or I could get a steady stream of 54 Mbps, sometimes better on the 2.4 GHz band. With 2 floors in between (router in the basement and my computer on the second floor and at the other end of the house, some 70-80 ft. away) the 5 MHz band became practically unusable (I will post some inSSIDer shots) and the 2.4 GHz band would get me 6-24 Mbps, still okay for Web browsing. The computers on the second floor right above the router get a steady 50-70 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band.I would like to note that, while the router broadcasting on 2 bands does have its advantages the 5 GHz signal works best when you have line of sight to the router or one thin wall/floor in between. It's not as good at passing through walls as the 2.4 GHz signal. It is possible to maximize performance by using a combination of wired plus 2 segregated bands but some testing and good planning is needed.RELIABILITY (4.5 of 5)The E3200 has been remarkably stable so far if I don't consider the random signal loss on the 5 GHz frequency on the second floor. It's fair to state that, when the default settings are kept, the router will automatically switch between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and between the available channels on each band to maximize performance and minimize interference. Since I don't have neighbors, I can't say how the router would perform in a more crowded environment.Due to a number of violent storms, we lost power for seconds at a time several times in the past few days. Whenever that happened, the router came back on its own and I was able to resume work without having to reestablish a VPN connection or the chat session on WebEx with a Cisco support rep.EXTRA FEATURES (4.5 of 5)The E3200 is chuck-full of advanced features including strong security and encryption and the ability to optimize it for gaming (not tested yet) and, of course, the most visible being the USB port through which you can share files off an attached disk with control over access level on the local network and over the Internet.On my features wish list... I wish it was possible to actually control the signal strength because the 5 GHz band is clearly underpowered. Also, while it is possible to remotely reboot the router, it would have been nice if a physical 'off' switch was available.WARRANTY AND SUPPORT (2 of 5)There is a 1 year more or less standard limited warranty. The full terms are posted at Cisco's site so I'm not going to go into details. My experience with routers - and this is my 4th or 5th wireless - is that, if they work, they last forever.The support... I can't say that I had a happy experience. Before I Googled for '5 GHz signal strength' I thought I'd ask a Cisco support person about it over a chat session. I also wanted to ask about the on and off loss of connection over the 5 GHz band.

I can't see how you can go wrong with this one.____________________________________________________TIME CHECK: 11 MONTHS SINCE INSTALLATIONMay, 2012: almost one year of nearly-flawless operation proved that the E3200 is stable and dependable and its operation comes close to 'zero maintenance'. It rarely needed rebooting while operating under sometimes extreme stress with multiple devices doing 'video', VPN and online gaming. I am now replacing the E3200 with the slightly more capable (larger bandwidth) EA3500._________________________________________________Update July 3, 2013One star goes off for the horrible customer service.

Sharp's product is not the coolest of them all - a little bit on the bulky side - but it somewhat old-fashioned design is more than compensated by the bar's sheer power - FOUR HUNDRED WATT people - and some extra feature that make it seriously compete with today's low to mid-range receivers/speakers combos.The following make Sharp's bar a good buy, in my view:- Powerful sound. 400W is sufficient to fill up with sound your basement disco.- Tuner. Indeed, the receiver box, the one that's not the woofer, allows you to hook up AM and FM antennas and there you have it: radio.- HDMI with THREE HDMI IN ports and on HDMI OUT with ARM (audio return channel) support.- Additional I/O includes optical and coax.- Everything is included: remote control, wires, wall mounting brackets and template for wall mounting, stands... the woofer too.- Super easy to use with the provided remote control.I can't think of anything 'bad' to say about it other than the somewhat dated design but... you're likely to use this with a TV so most of the time you'll be watching the TV screen not the sound bar  so it's not big deal.As for the sound, it's pretty good actually, considering the price but, of course, don't expect $3000 sound coming out of a $300 sound bar.

And, of course, there's the open Honeycomb and the freedom that a reasonably open OS gives you without having to wait for jailer's okay - no need to jailbreak. You are free by default as you should be. I so wanted an open Wi-Fi tablet so maybe I am a little overenthusiastic but I totally jumped on this one when it became available because it's the first non-iTablet that actually makes sense IF you don't care about 3G/4G.I've only been using the Transformer for a couple of days and I haven't reached the top of the learning curve so I'm not going to write a lot about the various apps but I've had enough time to get to know the hardware part and basic capabilities and, for someone quite skeptical when it came to 'tablets' all I can say is that I am impressed, especially when comparing it with the other tablets out there. And this is why:- Price - beats all the others at the time I'm writing this.- Display size - 10.1"", 16x9 (wide screen). Can't really compare it with the iPad because iPad's 9.7"" screen is in a 4x3 format - more square inches but movies show much better on a 16x9 screen.- Resolution - 1280x800 translates in 30% more pixels than iPad's and it's a beautiful, bright image. However, you can't really use it outside unless it's a cloudy day. For reading on the beach, there's the Kindle :)- Internal memory - 1 GB is twice as much than iPad's (better multi-tasking) and on par with the more expensive Xoom.- Processor - 1GHz NVIDIA Tegra 2 (2 x Cortex A9) is on par with Xoom, clock speed similar with iPad 2.- Storage - 16 GB, same as iPad 2 but Xoom comes with 32GB. Expandable through microSD.- Weight - about 1.5 lbs., comparable with iPad's and Xoom's- Cameras - 5MP rear camera for picture or video-taking and a 1.2MP front facing for video chat. Quite happy so far but there is no flash.- Speakers - 2 SRS on the sides so they won't be muffled if you lay it flat. I believe the iPad has only one.- Charging - via wall connector or USB but it took overnight to fully charge the tablet over USB - expected because tablets come with larger batteries. The dedicated port does it in a couple of hours.- Battery life - I was able to do 7-8 hours on a full charge, not as good as iPad but close.Other features/capabilities include Bluetooth, GPS, Flash (haven't installed the upgrade yet), remote control of Windows and Macs (it works).ERGONOMICSThe Transformer is slightly heavier than the iPad but not significantly so. The 16x9 format is very good for movie viewing and, because it's wider, it makes for better integration with the dock expansion.I like the mostly glass front with a little metal on the edges but the plastic back is so-so. It's solid but you can squeeze it if you really try - it gives to pressure.The screen is responsive to touch. I haven't been a heavy 'touch' user until the Transformer so I am not going to make any comparisons but I am pleased. The fine resolution  makes serious multitasking not only possible but also practical. The Transformer has more pixels than the iPad and it shows.THE DOCKI must confess that even though I'm the current user, I bought the Transformer for one of my kids - because he did so well in school but he's getting it in a month or so on his birthday - and I decided to splurge a little, ordering the 'dock'. Hasn't arrived yet - back ordered - but someone I know has one and I was able to test-drive it for about one hour.I haven't used it extensively but, anyone who's used netbooks will immediately recognize one as soon as the Transformer plugs into the keyboard-plus expansion. Besides the physical keyboard which integrates well with the OS and adds lots of dedicated buttons, the dock has a built-in battery, 2 extra USB ports and a SD card port. My impression is that, once plugged into the dock, it charges the tablet and all power comes from the dock's battery for as long as the battery has power. As for how it feels... let me say that I'm a lot more comfortable with a full size keyboard..When docked you can actually fold the Transformer closed with the dock as the keyboard bottom and you end up with something that's hard to distinguish from a netbook, only it's running an Android OS.MY EXPERIENCEI am still getting myself used to a touch-driven OS and the built in apps and I didn't get a lot of third-party apps but not everything ran - tech support told me that not everything 'Android' will automatically run on Honeycomb so... try before you buy :) . However, whatever ran it did so without major problems. Except... playback was sometimes choppy when on full-screen mode but maybe it was so because I was running half a dozen other things at the same time.I should note that WiFi integration was flawless and, indeed, once on my local network, I was able not only to stream from media servers but to also open remote sessions on some of our Windows 7 and Windows Home Server machines.MY EVALUATIONAfter a few days of use I am very happy with my purchase and I am considering a second for my other teen kid - but I may wait for the next great tablet because I don't expect the Transformer to stay the top non-Apple tablet forever. I wrote 'top tablet' because this is the best WiFi tablet deal you can get today.The Transformer has a few minor issues: USB charging, the not-so-hard back, a little on the heavy side but the pluses overwhelm the 'issues' and the dock expansion is extremely innovative and it can even be a good 'transition' prop for those familiar with netbooks - but it does come at a price.I love my Transformer and Amazon's rating for 'I love it' is 5 stars.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[12, 13]",Breakthrough,2011,04, 30,0.9230769230769231,5998,1082,Positive,12,13,1,0.022765021983390327,20110430

Yes, it does show the time and the date but the value comes from its ability to keep track of your running and provide you with such details as your fastest mile, distance covered, your pace as you are running, the dates and times of your runs and so forth. By the way, it looks good too.WHAT's IN THE BOX* The GPS-enabled watch itself* The Nike shoe pod sensor to be used when running indoors and there's no GPS signal* A USB Type A male/Type A female cable for charging the watch and communicating with Nike's Web site via your computer* A multi-lingual (13 languages) little manual/startup guideA heartbeat sensor is NOT included but can be purchased separately.Nike recommends that you log into their site and set up an account. This is optional but anyone who wants to feel the community spirit and be subjected to Nike's marketing should benefit from it.SETUP AND OPERATIONGetting started is as easy as plugging the watch into your computer via the USB. That seems to be the only way for setting the watch's date and time (unless it gets them from the GPS satellite). While plugged in, the watch is also charged so make sure that you use a 'powered' USB port. And, while at it, the watch also installs an app on your computer and communicates with Nike's site.Then... you're ready to go. Or run. Operation is as simple as tapping the watch face to light up the display for a few seconds. You also have three buttons to browse through menus and select actions or set preferences. Having the watch record a run can be as simple as pressing the green-colored button for a couple of seconds and, as soon as the watch confirms that it found a satellite (or the sensor in your shoe) you can run. Once you're done, you press the same button again and everything is recorded. Of course, it can be a lot more complicated than that but only if you want to.It's probably worth stating that, while this watch may be aware of your position on Earth it's only using it to track your runs (pace, distance, time). The watch does NOT display any maps and it will NOT help you find 'home' if you get lost.MY IMPRESSIONS AND RATINGI'm coming back to the first paragraph: this watch is for runners. If you are a runner and are looking for something more sophisticated AND more stylish than a pedometer and the price is not a turnoff, than this is for you. My wife runs and she loves it. However, even if the above is true, this watch may not be for you if you are thick-wristed.

I was lucky to grab theASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Tablet Only)on launch date and he just got the Iconia. Both of us are on the market for at least one, possibly 2 more tablets (me with 2 high school kids and a third catching up fast) so we agreed to swap our new gadgets for a couple of days so we could each better decide what our second Android tablet was going to be.Here's my 2-day evaluation of Iconia vs. Transformer with frequent references to the other better known tablet players such as the iPad and the Xoom. This is going to be a quick and incomplete comparison so do feel free to add your own categories as comments to this review.- FREEDOM (even) - They are both non-iPad tablets that are technologically on par (and here and there superior) with the 'leader' AND reasonably priced AND, unlike the iPad, they don't force us, the paying customers, into some 'ecosystem' mandatory straightjacket. While not perfect, both the Transformer and Iconia offer a great deal when it comes to features and expandability. The Honeycomb is a reasonably open OS. You are free by default as you should be. There's no need to jailbreak because you're free. You can shop on more than one app store, do comparison shopping, download beta code and you can even run Flash.But let me continue with my brief Transformer vs. Iconia comparison.- PRICE (Transformer) - with everything else more or less equal, the Asus tablet beats the Iconia by $50. It can be argued that the Iconia has some advantages - I like its solid aluminum backside - but the Transformer has its own so, on a Dollar vs. Dollar competition, the Transformer wins. They each come with options and expansions but, unlike cars, you can get a lot off the base models.- DISPLAY (even) - Both come with 10.1"", 16x9 (wide screen). In my view, they both beat the iPad's 9.7"" screen which is in a 4x3 format. Apples has a few more square inches but movies show much better on a 16x9 screen. The viewing angle is quite wide with few distortions and the colors are rich and bright when used in a room under natural or artificial light. Outside, the glare is significant.- RESOLUTION (even) - 1280x800 on both the Transformer and the Iconia translate in 30% more pixels than iPad's and a few more pixels per square inch.- INTERNAL MEMORY (even) - 1 GB is twice as much than iPad's (better multi-tasking) and on par with the more expensive Xoom.- PROCESSOR (even) - 1GHz NVIDIA Tegra 2 (2 x Cortex A9) is on par with Xoom, clock speed similar with iPad 2.- STORAGE (even) - 16 GB, same as iPad 2 but Xoom comes with 32GB. Both are expandable through microSD.- WEIGHT (even) - they are both slightly heavier than the iPad or the Xoom but only slightly.- CAMERAS (Iconia) - they both come with 5MP rear camera for picture or video-taking but the Iconia has a 2MP front facing vs. the Transformer's 1.2MP. In addition, the Iconia has a flash which the Transformer lacks. Iconia's pictures appeared a little crisper to me.- PHYSICAL BUILT (Iconia) - Transformer's plastic back is not a major concern to me but Iconia's solid aluminum armor makes it the clear winner in this category. The Iconia feels like a solid, well-designed product.- MULTIMEDIA (Transformer) - I had problems with the Iconia accessing content from other media servers on the network while all was more or less flawless with the Transformer. It's a significant plus for the Transformer but my friend is telling me that the Iconia may get a soft upgrade soon that should take care of this. To be fair, I had to update the Transformer before I could use some of the cooler (MyCloud) features.- EXTRA FEATURES (Transformer) - The Transformer comes with a well thought/designed dock/keyboard/expansion option that will effectively 'transform' it into an Android-running netbook. Do people who buy tablets actually want to transform them into netbooks? That's a good question. I'm not sure I do but at least one of my kids believes that he could use the physical keyboard. The Transformer's MyCloud makes it very easy to remotely control other computers and get access to digital content.I didn't have sufficient time to extensively test battery life or downloaded apps but I can say that Kindle and Gmail work great on both tablets.EVALUATIONFollowing the 2-day swap we both agree that The Transformer has the edge at this time and, unless something completely new and unexpected emerges in the next couple of months we are both likely to get a Transformer as our second tablet. However, there is the AVAILABILITY category where, at the time I'm writing this, the Iconia beats the Transformer hands down because you can actually buy one at the list price. This is going to change, for sure.My friend likes the Iconia and so do I but we both like the Transformer more. Let me say this: I missed my Transformer over the weekend. We only wish we could get one or, in my case, a second one.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[418, 447]",Iconia vs. Transformer,2011,05, 9,0.9351230425055929,5043,883,Positive,418,447,29,0.03507572056668295,20110509

Dent ""Aragorn""",1327449600,2.0,B004YI9NTS,"01 25, 2012","I must say from the get-go that I've been using and enjoying a Logitech Squeezebox for the past 2.5 years. It may sound unfair to mention `the competition' in my review's first paragraph but the Mondo seems to be quite an overt attempt to make a better product by imitating the heck out of the Squeeze and maybe trying to improve a little here and there in the hope of coming out with a better product. After trying out the Mondo I feel that the Squeezebox is the superior product, by far.This is how they compare:THE LOOKS (Squeeze, without a doubt)It would be hard to tell the Squeeze from the Mondo from 20 feet away. The Mondo is the same shape, slightly larger but the face layout is nearly identical: speaker on the left, little display on the upper right (Mondo's is a little larger but the resolution is the same), round dials, rows of buttons for preset stations.The difference is when you get closer. The Squeezebox almost screams `high end'. Both boxes are plastic but Mondo's is `cheap clock radio' finish while the Squeeze has a sleek, beautiful finish and it kept it so after 2.5 years of operating the kitchen. Add to that the beautiful, much higher pixel density Squeezebox display and we have a clear winner.SETUP AND OPERATION (Squeeze)The Squeezebox `just worked', almost literally within seconds of plugging it and it worked well for the past 2.5 years. It immediately recognized our Wi-Fi network and once the password was entered it was ready. The Mondo seemed to be confused by our Wi-Fi Cisco range extender - thought it found two networks with the exact same name. Then, it spent a lot of time updating itself, rebooting...The controls are nearly identical. Dials that you turn to cycle through menu selections and push to select, buttons that you keep pressed to associate them with your selection.The menus are a tie only because the Squeezebox options are so many and the menu tree so deep you sometimes get lost. Mondo offers a lot fewer selections and it can be sometimes easier to perform simple tasks but the way things are organized doesn't always make sense - why is the weather forecast under `Internet Radio', right after College Stations? I don't know.While the Squeezebox does almost instant play, whether it's Pandora or some station in Australia, the Mondo spends a good chunk of time downloading and buffering. Switching from one task to another is a gamble. Last time I tried to move from Pandora to a radio station the display told me that it was trying to found a 'gateway'. It never did and I had to unplug it. Restarting played the radio station without gateway issues but I don't like unplugging my radio when I want to listen to a new station.FEATURES (a tie, probably)The Mondo has a few things going for it. There are 10 preset stations vs. only 6 at the Squeezebox and it displays the stream's quality, a capability that I actually missed on the Squeezebox. While the Sqeezebox alarm setup options are orders of magnitude above Mondo's, the Mondo comes with a `snooze' button on the top, just like the clock radios. Very convenient.The Squeezebox wins hands down when it comes to the sheer number and variety of services (dozens for the Squeezebox vs. about five at the time I'm writing this for the Mondo) with the ability to, for example, play Flickr or Picasa slideshows thanks to its superior display.Finally, the Mondo comes with a remote control while the Squeeze doesn't. The remote control looks 'cheap' but I score this as a major plus for the Mondo. Mondo's controls both on the box face and on the remote are Pandora-optimized.RELIABILITY AND PERFORMANCE (not Mondo)Mondo's software seems to be in need of a major overhaul. Besides spending too much time buffering and downloading, it quickly gets confused when switching between services or multitasking. It's confused to the point where only a hard reboot can clear things up and `that' means, again, spending a lot of time discovering the network, signing up, loading, buffering... I don't have such problems on the Squeezebox.Probably because of how 'buffering' is handled I found that Mondo frequently cuts off the end of songs and at times skips to the next song way before the end is reached when playing Pandora. Something that a firmware upgrade may be able to fix but this is what's happening now.MY RATINGGiven that they are offered at more or less the same price, if I wanted another Internet radio it would not be a Mondo. It is not a disaster - it plays radio stations and the remote, as cheap-looking as it is it's still a nice thing to have but the much older Squeezebox beats it in just about any way you look at the two. I see a near unanimity of 5-star reviews full of praise for the Mondo but I can only provide my own views.As ungrateful as it may sound, given that I didn't have to pay for the Mondo, I will say that I don't like it that much. Amazon's 3 stars stand for ""It's Okay"" but the Mondo is not. It may become so, possibly after its software is updated to ensure more reliable operation. Until then, it's a 2-star which stands for `I don't like it' yet.","[12, 14]",The sincerest form of flattery (Mondo vs. the Squeeze),2012,01, 25,0.8571428571428571,5096,898,Negative,12,14,2,0.02273245399772024,20120125

Anyone who seeks simplicity and and a space/saving quality keyboard/mouse combo should be happy with the ""SlimStar 8000"" and I will explain why below.FEATURES THAT I LIKE- Space saving while still a near 'full size' keyboard is the main positive. At 16"" by 4.5"" and only about half an inch thick the keyboard leaves room for everything else on your desk and, being wireless, can be easily moved out of the way if needed. The keys are large enough to allow for comfortable typing.- Keyboard is actually good. I'm a fast touch typist and I found myself fast touch-typing away on this keyboard within minutes. I actually like its feel.- Sensitive 1200 dpi mouse. There's nothing special about the mouse: 2 buttons and the clickable scroll wheel other than it's extremely responsive and precise.- Ease of installation, batteries included. Once the (included) 3 AAA batteries are in place, 1 for keyboard, 2 for mouse and the USB receiver is plugged into your desktop/laptop USB port you are ready to go. All works perfectly, or it does on my Windows 7 laptop.- Clever design. As one who's spilled his fair share of coffee on his various keyboards I appreciate the 8 (counted them) water drill holes on the base that would at least partially mitigate such disasters.- Price, of course. It's quite a deal for a good keyboard/mouse combo.THINGS NOT EVERYONE MAY LIKE- Mouse is small. 2"" wide by 4"" long, it works best if operated with small hands. I can still use it but an 8-10 yr. old should find this mouse ideal.- It's not clear whether the mouse on/off switch should be used to preserve battery life. I don't know for how long the battery in this mouse is going to last but, if it doesn't last 'for months' I will come back to this review and report my findings. For comparison sake I've been using a wireless Logitech mouse for more than six months now and it's still with the original battery.- Receiver is not 'nano' size. At almost 1"" long, some laptop users may not something that long coming out of an USB port. Of course, not a problem if used with a desktop.- Narrow function keys. The upper row which includes Esc, the Fxx keys, PrtScr, Scroll, Pause and the speaker volume buttons are half size. Depending on how often you need to press F5 or F11 this may or may not be an issue.MY RATINGI hesitated between 4 and 5 stars, with 5 stars meaning ""I love it"" because this is not a perfect product. But, the negatives listed above notwithstanding, it turns out that I actually love the ""SlimStar 8000"" (quite a name for a cheap keyboard). At this time I'm debating with myself whether I'm going to take it to my office or give it to our 8 yr. girl to use with her desktop. In the end... it's going to be her decision :).Answering the question: knowing what I know today, would I buy the SlimStar 8000 if I needed a good wireless/mouse keyboard combo and price was a factor? The answer is yes so, 5 stars it is. A future downgrade is possible if battery life is not up to expectations.","[4, 4]",Surprisingly good,2011,12, 20,1.0,3078,553,Positive,4,4,0,0.022537046083699722,20111220

Quality aside, the M300 feels and looks a little bit behind the times in both design, ergonomics and specs. As much as I am trying to find a reason to pick this specific unit over whatever else is available out there at a similar price point, I can't think of one and here it why.FEATURESAs most players within this price range, the M300 comes with 4GB or memory, a MicroSD slot and it connects to a computer via a mini (not 'micro') USB port. It plays music with the usual options: by album, genre, shuffle, repeat/no repeat and so on. It also has video capabilities on its 1.45"" display and it comes with a preloaded audio book. The built-in microphone allows for voice recordings that can be later played back. Other features include an FM radio using the headphones as the antenna and the ability to pair with a playback bluetooth device such as headphones. Headphones and a (too) short 2-inch USB cable are included. The user manual can be accessed on a computer when connected via the USB.POSITIVESI can't think of any outstanding features. A lot of what this player does is 'Okay' - it plays music well - but, sadly, nothing outstanding.NEGATIVESHere comes the long list:* Poor quality control. Like I said, at least one of the the touch 'buttons' does not work for me.* Poor engineering. The touch controls that work do so barely. It's not easy to navigate the menus because sometimes the buttons need to be pressed more than once and done so hard.* Poor ergonomics. See above. In addition to the touch control, the volume control is a physical rocker that's difficult to operate and the power/lock slider requires long nails or some tool with a tip to operate.* Low-end headphones. Need I say more?* Too short USB cable. I suspect it would not have been a major expense to include a 4 in. USB wire instead of the 2 in. that came with this unit.* Poor design. This unit is bulky.* Technologically behind the times, just a little bit. A device this size would have justified a 'micro' USB port but it comes with a 'mini' instead. A 'touch' screen would have made much more sense because it would have allowed for a larger screen while preserving the small size and avoid the touch controls issues I am experiencing.* Near bullet-proof plastic clamshell packaging, not easy to take the Zen out of it. Beware of cuts.MY RATINGThis is a 2-star (barely) and not a 1-star because this device does play music but that's just about all I can say about it. I didn't have to pay for this unit but, had I purchased it, I would not be happy with my purchase and I would probably try to find a way to return it for the reasons I stated above._________________________________________Note:The ZEN people were very eager to help address the button issue and, to firmware upgrades later, the 'fifth button' is now responsive. With the menu button functional I can now do things such as setting the correct time and date and operate the player the way I expected  from the very beginning.I will upgrade my review to 3-stars. If you player's menu button does not work, contact ZEN or check their site for the upgraded firmware.","[1, 1]",4 out of 5 of Ain't Good,2011,10, 25,1.0,3282,584,Neutral,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20111025

I also approve of the braided wires, a little stiff though.More positives? They come with a nice velvety pouch and three different size pairs of silicone gels, designed and engineered in Scotland. They are also extremely comfortable to wear - I had them on for a couple of hours and felt no discomfort whatsoever.Now, for the sound... What makes/breaks earbuds is their ability to deliver the lower end of the audio spectrum, the bass that is. And when it comes to bass, the MA-350 aren't as impressive as I hoped - could it be the all-aluminum body?

Almost every other similar device I tested came with a built-in rechargeable battery and it would live on one charge for weeks or months.____________________________________________________________________________What's better than a wireless keyboard for the iPad? One that also works with an iPod or an iPhone. And what's better than that? How about one that works with... everything AND comes with a carrying case that can quickly turn into a stand?Logitech's modesty notwithstanding - calling it a 'tablet' keyboard 'for iPad' - this happens to also work with the iPods and the iPhones (verified) and, even better, I was able to successfully pair and use it with: a Sony PS3, a Motorola XOOM (Android 3.2) tablet and a Lenovo T400 laptop running Windows 7. In fact, I am using Logitech's little keyboard to write this review on the T400. I could not pair the keyboard with a Blackberry Torch because, while it did recognize it, the Blackberry asked that I entered a secret code that the keyboard expected and 'zeroes' did not work. The only problem, and this IS a major annoyance, the keyboard only remembers the last pairing. Once I paired it with the PS3, it forgot about the iPhone. Pairing it with the XOOM made it forget about the PS3 so, if you want to use it with multiple devices you'll have to go through the about 30-second 'pairing' process every time you switch. Not good.The keyboard, while not 'full size' is large enough and responsive enough to allow for fast typing. I was pleasantly surprised to see that most 'special functions'  worked on the non-Apple devices - could control the speakers on/off and volume and the player on the T400 and the XOOM, the magnifying glass key brought up 'search' and so on. Pretty good, actually.And, of course, there's more to this bundle than just the keyboard. Included is a VERY well designed dual-function stand/case. When 'folded', side magnets keep it together as a case into which you can slide the keyboard but it only takes a couple of seconds to reconfigure it as a stand for your tablet.POSITIVES- perfect iDevices integration- seems to work with just about anything (except my Blackberry Torch) that supports Bluetooth- excellent keyboard layout, design- multi-function case/stand is easy to set, is cool looking and protects the keyboard- 3-year limited 'hardware' warranty- batteries includedNEGATIVE- keyboard doesn't remember more than one pairing (annoying)MY RATINGThis is a near-perfect product and the price is not so bad either. However, even if this was sold as an iPad/iPod/iPhone device only, the ability for a Bluetooth device to remember more than one pairing falls within 'reasonable expectations' and its inability to do so is a disappointment. I will reluctantly subtract one star because this is a major issue with me as I would like to be able to use this with a phone, a tablet and a gaming console. Hopefully, Logitech listens and will either explain this or... prove me wrong and and show how the keyboard can be made to remember more than one Bluetooth partner.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[0, 0]",Update: Burns through batteries way too fast,2011,08, 3,,3326,559,Negative,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20110803

It can be used just about anywhere in the world (100-240V) for as long as you have the proper plug adapter.To charge a Kindle you will need a generic USB Type A/Micro B cable and one is supplied with every Kindle purchased and you can do it in several different ways:- Off a laptop or PC through one of their 'powered' USB ports (you will need a laptop or a PC)- With this adapter which comes with all Kindle 3s or can be purchased separately (you will need the Amazon-supplied or any generic USB cable)- With a third-party, branded or generic USB charger (search Amazon for either 'kindle charger' or 'usb charger')This specific charger works for all 3d and 4th generation Kindles and is also great for charging lots of other gadgets that get charged through an USB port. I'm using it to charge my Blackberry Torch, a couple of other phones and the kids charge their MP3 players. And the reverse is also true: most other USB chargers will work with your Kindle. One good example is the Blackberry's.Amazon's charger may cost a couple of dollars more than a generic but it comes with Amazon's logo and some peace of mind.

It's not audiophile quality and it's not 'surround' - the attempts at subwoofer emulation are not always convincing - but it's an improvement over what I can get out of my tablet's built-in speakers.- VOLUME - It's somewhat higher than the max I can get out of the built-in speakers but it's not a lot louder.- 360-DEGREE - it comes pretty close, actually. It's close enough to 360-degree sound projection to accept Logitech's claim.- EASE OF INSTALLATION - It's simply clip, plug and play and there's not much else to say.- PHYSICAL SETUP - It took about 2 seconds to clip it. The setup is exactly what the Amazon picture shows. The removal is as easy as the attachment.- DESIGN - When not in use it resembles a mini folded umbrella. The clip folds into the body.- TRAVEL/STORAGE POUCH - It won't provide much fall protection but I agree with Logitech that it should protect your gadget from scratches.- POWER, VOLUME UP/DOWN BUTTONS - Again, something not likely to use much given that there are so many alternative ways to control the sound but good to have.OPERATION, USES------------------The way you operate it is like this: you take it out of the pouch, clip it, plug it, listen. When you're done, you do the above in reverse.By and large, Logitech's claims are true. The device lives up to the marketing claims. BUT... is it needed? Assuming that it's meant to be used while traveling, obviously, it can't be for air travel so, maybe some may want to listen to laptop-stored music or watch video with better quality sound while in a hotel room? Possibly. And for THAT use this is a good solution. I can also see how some may attach the it while making a presentation but my experience is that most presentations involve stored visuals while the 'audio' comes from the presenter. There may be some other good uses but I can't think of any at this time.RATING-------This is a high quality product, especially when the price is considered - in other words GOOD VALUE - but it's something that has rather limited uses in real life. I was happy to test this product from Logitech, I found no major faults and quite a few things to appreciate but I must admit that its uses are quite limited.My 4 star rating (I like it) reflects its good quality but limited use. The advantages it has over alternative portable solutions such as Bluetooth-connected wireless speakers is its simplicity - you plug it and it plays and its good value.

It also has 2 USB charging ports. It will protect whatever is plugged in against power surges for as long as it is properly plugged and grounded itself. It does NOT protect or support coax, Ethernet or phone line connections - Belkin and other vendors offer models with such features.My personal experience does validate the claims the manufacturer makes for the features that I am using and I can verify at this time. Currently, I have 10 devices plugged into the surge protector, including 5 DC adapters and 5 2/3-prong plugs. The 2 remaining slots are unobstructed and could be used if needed.So far, I am happy and based on its meeting my real needs, good design, features and low price I recommend it as (in my view) one of the best it its class.MORE DETAILSThe following are noteworthy, in my view.Positives:&#128078; TRUE 12-outlet capacity. Unlike the traditional surge-protected power strips where one beefy AC adapter would cover 2 slots, Belkin's device truly accommodates 6 AC adapters and allows for 6 more plugs to fit in.&#128078; 'Protected' green light (must be on) provides assurance that the surge protector is operational. When the green light stays off it usually means that the surge protector 'expired' while protecting your device from a power surge and it must be replaced ASAP.&#128078; 'Not grounded' red light (must be off) will warn you when there's something wrong. Belkin's warranty won't apply if the light was on when your devices got fried. I don't know if for a fact but I assume they have a way of telling if that was the case.&#128078; 6 ft. long chord, quite adequate.&#128078; Integrated clip for cable management that can be lowered into the body if not in use. I find it useful.&#128078; Thin (one inch) and flat shape. Stands well on a table or on the floor.Negatives:- Other than encouraging the unrealistic expectation that Belkin would pay you up to a gazillion dollars on connected equipment warranty coverage, I can't think of anything bad.WARRANTYOn a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a worthless warranty and 10 is one that's unbelievably generous, Belkin's should be somewhere around 2 or 3 - 95% of all warranties on devices this cheap are likely to be a 1.They do promise to replace the item if it sacrifices itself while protecting your devices for as long as you can prove that you didn't do anything stupid, you have a purchase receipt and you ship the damaged item to Belkin at your own expense. It's not clear if they will charge you for shipping you back a new item. This may or may not be something worth pursuing. My impression is that you are not going to save a lot of money by getting a 'free' replacement from Belkin and you are likely to waste a lot of time in the process. I'd probably buy myself a new one if the one I have now stopped working but it's good to know that they do have a 'lifetime' warranty. By 'lifetime' they mean the natural life of the product but 'natural life' is not precisely defined.As far as being reimbursed for damage to devices that this surge protector was expected to protect, my impression is that you are not likely to get much if anything unless you can afford a lawyer and you are willing to sue. You have to meet a long series of requirements that are expressed in several paragraphs of techno-legalese.RATINGI will have to repeat myself stating that, in my view, this is one of the best in its class and the price is right. My expectations were met as far as design, cord length and warranty (that expectation was low). My expectations were exceeded when it comes to the plugs layout with ample room for 6 wide adapters and the adding of 2 USB charging ports.Maybe I should have removed one star from the over hyped connected equipment warranty statement but... as sad as it is, everybody does it and Belkin's warranty is better than most so, I am awarding 5 stars on an item that inexpensively addresses real needs I have with protecting the many devices clustered in a corner of my basement.","[1, 1]","Meets all my expectations, exceeds some",2013,04, 2,1.0,4114,725,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20130402

With the Range Extender (it's a wireless repeater) plugged into a wall outlet on the first floor I am now getting 4-5 bars consistently and about 65Mbps. Problem solved.I am happy with my purchase because the RE1000 finally solves a problem and it's one thing I will not have to worry about and because it's one of the easiest to set up 'networking' gadgets I know of. So, these are the facts and my experience.WHAT YOU GET* The RE1000 Range Extender itself* CD that has the setup utility and the manual* AC cord, just in case you don't want to plug it directly into the wall outlet* AC power connector cover* A short Ethernet cable that may be needed for setupWHAT ELSE YOU NEED* A wireless b/g/n router, obviously* PC or Mac with Wi-Fi and a CD drive to run the setup* Some Web browser to run the more sophisticated setup and administration activitiesSETUP AND INSTALLATIONIt's as easy as running the Setup program. After a minute or so you are asked to plug the device into a power outlet somewhere near the router for it to be 'discovered'. That's done quickly and the RE1000 is ready to use by plugging it directly into a wall outlet or you can use the supplied cord.More sophisticated admin tasks can be performed through a browser. You will need to know RE1000's IP address for that to work. Through your favorite Web browser, you can associate your device with a specific access point or router and determine signal strength at various locations to determine your extender's optimal placement.There are more options but none was needed with our CISCO router and it should be the case with most b/g/n routers.RATINGI wish that all 'electronics' were this easy and efficient. Once the 5-minute setup is done you can plug this anywhere in the house (within your router's range) and it will just work. We happened to have a stormy day yesterday and we lost power several times - not an uncommon occurrence - and every time the RE1000 reconnected itself to the router once the power came back and did its magic without requiring any human intervention.

Especially if it's one I've never heard of before. Well... I am about to write a gushing review for a product I've never heard before because VSonic sent me a free 'for review' unit and I'm at a loss finding any major flaws.Let me begin with anything that would go under 'negatives'.- It looks, feels and, more importantly sounds almost exactly like a 'Sennheiser IE80'. I'm not sure if this is a negative. I am not saying that VSonic's is a Sennheiser exact copycat but I have little doubt that Sennheiser was their inspiration.- The wire doesn't seem to match the quality of the headphones themselves. It is a little more rigid than I'd feel fully comfortable with and it appears to be the exact same wire I found on a pair of another much less expensive Made in China headphones.- They are Made in China and that includes the design and engineering. Not everyone may feel comfortable spending a lot of money on a brand that doesn't yet have a following outside of the maker's own country.- My 'for review' unit came without a manual or a warranty statement. I emailed VSonic and the reply I received stated ""all the manual and factory information will be in retail package"". I hope it is the case.Now, with the negatives out of the way and after burning them in, as recommended, for about 200 hours, I will state that these are the best-sounding earbuds in this price range and they come close if not match the Sennheiser IE80 which sell for twice as much.Words to describe my experience are: perfect balance, comfortable, crisp, brilliant. I am not a fan of in-ear headphones but if there are earbuds I'd use VSonic's would be among the few that qualified. Like the more expensive brands VSonic aspires to emulates, these headphones have no noticeable bass and/or acute biases so they are not going to sound like a boombox (unless you play them with an equalizer set to emulate one). The quality of music heard through the VSonic is as good and brilliant or as bad and dull as the source. Well played, mixed and recorded music will sound that way - yes, The Dark Side of the Moon will blow your mind (listened to the whole album after the final tune was played at the London Olympics opening) but music that sounds bad no matter where or how you play it will not sound good on the VSonic either. I've been listening for many hours and I was unable to detect any imperfections or distortions that didn't exist on the original recording.As far as comfort is concerned, with the volume at the proper level, I was able to wear them for hours without the slightest bother. This is something because I don't tolerate in-ear phones very well. Absent a manual, it's probably worth stating that you MUST wear them with the wires going up and then over and behind your ear. If you find it difficult to keep the buds in your ear you are not wearing them correctly. If worn right and if you attach the gel that fits your ear the best then the buds are going to stay securely in your ear and you will not feel them while the music starts playing.The unit I received came with an enormous amount of eartips (15 pairs?) in various sizes plus a pair of over the ear wire guides. I also found two cases: one soft-leather VSonic-labeled that can be used to store the eartips and a zippered, round hard case labelled INNOVIC good for keeping the earphones. I am not sure if everyone gets the same so please let me know and I will be happy to update my review. I found it easy to replace the eartips and practice made me better at it. They are not only comfortable to wear but also easy to clean.__________________________________________________Here are the specs, as published on the case:Driver Unit: 11mm High Dynamic CCAWDiaphragms: Bio-celluloseRated Impedance: 500 Ohms +/- 10%Frequency Response: 7Hz-30,000HzDistortion &lt; 0.2% 105dBChannel Balance &lt; 1dB (at 500Hz), &lt; 1.5dB (at 20Hz-12.5KHz)Rated Power: 10mWMax Input Power: 50mWPlug: 3.5mm, 24K gold plated dual-channelCable: 1.3m max 82-core silver wire__________________________________________________The negatives or potential negatives noted above, I will grant these head phones the full 5-stars because I can't stop loving them and because, in my view, they match or surpass anything in existence at this price point and many much higher-priced models.","[0, 0]",Can't stop loving them,2012,08, 5,,4445,771,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20120805

For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port.- You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware such as a 3D Blu-ray player.- You may also consider this if you need an HDMI cable plain and simple because it will work with anything that requires HDMI.- You should definitely consider this cable if you prefer 'braided' cables.If you consider taking advantage of the Ethernet support, keep in mind that BOTH connected devices need to support the HDMI 1.4 standard for this cable to make a difference and that it is NOT possible to upgrade any existing equipment (TV, Blu-ray player) to support HDMI 1.4. This being said, I would not buy an HDMI cable today unless it was v1.4 given that the price difference is insignificant or non-existent.HOW GOOD IS IT?On my equipment, this worked as well as any other HDMI wire. It replaced an older HDMI v1.3 wire at the back of my entertainment center and, nothing unexpected happened. The picture on my TV was as beautiful as before.Briefly, this cable:- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.A 5-star rating should be fair for this cable because it is fully HDMI 1.4/1.3x and the price is right.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 is a HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable supports the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' makes sense and is emerging as the common HDMI 1.4 cable standard.'Standard' cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i) and I am not aware of such products on the market. High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[13, 13]","Braided, short, inexpensive, full-featured",2012,08, 21,1.0,5121,850,Positive,13,13,0,0.0228301579547305,20120821

To place it all in some context, we currently use a XOOM, a Kindle Fire and an HP Touchpad, having previously owned a Galaxy Tab and having extensively tested an Acer Iconia A-500.Sadly, the Cruz is seriously behind times. Google has released Honeycomb as a tablet-specific OS but that may not be an option for this Cruz due to its one-core CPU and low memory. Yes, it can run Netflix and Pandora and most games and this is good and its face-facing camera makes video-chats possible. On the other hand, its lacking Bluetooth makes the tablet's own tiny speakers the only option for sound and pairing with a physical keyboard not a realistic option. Add to the above the poor, low-res display and the not always immediate response to finger or stylus input and you end up with a product that should not be on the market.I can't think of a good reason to purchase this Cruz considering the alternatives currently on the the market. The competition in the tablet marketplace is heating up and this is good for us, the intended users but it should also force the makers to come up with reasonably priced quality products.","[1, 1]","Unimpressive hardware, below average video, obsolete OS, sputtering performance",2011,11, 26,1.0,1718,290,Negative,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20111126

But let me discuss/rate the package in its entirety.CONTENTS, INSTALLATION, DOCUMENTATION WARRANTY (4.5 out of 5)This is what you get out of the box:* Sound Blaster Tactic Omega Wireless Headset (the headphones)* Detachable Microphone* Sound Blaster Recon (module that connects to the PC or gaming console)* Tactic Link wireless card (plugs into the Recon)* Installation CD (for PC only)* Inline volume control (for Xbox only)* Micro USB-to-USB cable (2 of them, will explain why)* Optical cableSetup is clearly illustrated by the Quick Start leaflet. It's as easy as attaching the wireless card to the Recon module and connecting the module to the PC or gaming console. Consoles are also using the optical cable. The Xbox requires that the Inline volume control wire is connected to the wireless controller (I only used it with a PS3 and a PC).The headphones charge from any PC or standard USB charger (not provided) through the provided USB cable. I used successfully both a PC and a third party PS3 charger. If used with a PC/laptop you should be able to use the second USB cable to charge the headphones while using them if needed. Once charged, the headphones will link to the Recon module within seconds of powerup.Half a star is lost for the warranty terms. It only lasts for one year and the shipping costs are the owner's responsibility. Make sure that you save the dated purchase receipt to avoid any surprises.OPERATION AND USER EXPERIENCE (5 stars out of 5)When used with a console, the Recon module and headphones all controls are good enough to provide a superior gamer (and not only) experience. Besides volume controls on both the module and the headphones, there is Mic Gain switch (low/mid/high) to control voice input. When playing games you can select the 'scout mode' especially on FPS which will enhance the sounds made by your opponents. The other option is THX TruStudio Pro mode, perfect for listening to music or movie watching.On a PC the options expand dramatically. You don't need to use the provided software on the PC but if you need total control over your THX setup - surround mode from 2 to 7 speakers, bass, crossover frequency - over how you are heard when you speak into the microphone (we're set to 'alien brute'), the dynamic range control plus a mixer and an equalizer that allows you to pick any of a number of preset profiles or make up your own... you will be using the software.I found the adjustable headphones to be extremely comfortable. Hours of use at a time caused no noticeable discomfort.RATING (5 stars)After trying this set out for a couple of weeks I was turned from a skeptical tester to an enthusiastic proponent.

Logitech's Boombox 8 drivers can nicely enhance a tablet's, laptop's or smartphone's sound capability and do it without the need of extra wires for as long as you have Bluetooth (wireless audio profile A2DB) on the host. While it's true that the Boombox works with iPads, Pods and Phones it's also true that it works with any other Bluetooth device. During my test drive the Boombox paired quickly with a couple of laptops, a XOOM tablet and, yes, an iPhone.THE POSITIVES+ Wireless all the way - once charged, it will play for several hours, completely detached from power outlets or the host.+ Easy setup - pairing is done in seconds. It remembers the lats 8 hosts it paired with.+ Simple controls - it's only 4 buttons: power on/off, 2 volume up and down and the Bluetooth pairing button.+ Good sound output - nothing to rave about but the sound quality is 'acceptable to good' nevertheless.+ Brief, to-the-point, one folded page English/Spanish/French manual that covers everything.+ 3.5mm audio cable included, just in case Bluetooth doesn't work for you.NEGATIVES AND LACKING- Not loud enough - for something that call itself a 'boombox' I expected it to be louder.- No handle - this makes it hard to carry it around.- No carrying case - this, combined with the above makes it a mostly stationary device which almost negates the benefits of it being able to operate on batteries for extended periods of time.- Little flexibility - 4 buttons make it easy to operate but it also means that options are lacking. There's nothing you can control besides power on/off, volume up/down and Bluetooth pairing.- No remote control. You have some remote control over the sound from the host device but it would have been nice if a simple remote was included.- Shiny black plastic surfaces, including on buttons makes it a fingerprint magnet. Lacking a remote control and a handle, you must touch the Boombox and every time you do you will leave visible fingerprints.MY RATINGNegatives duly noted, Logitech's Boombox is Okay. It does most of what you'd expect it to do and it does it reasonably well. This is not a high-end device (note the price) so expectations shouldn't be sky-high. Amazon's 3 stars stand of ""It's Okay"" and Okay it is. If would have been a 4-stars if it was a little louder and came with a handle but 3 stars is still a good rating.UPDATE: I am revising my rating to 4 stars because, when plugged in (not on batteries) the Boombox sound is nothing short of spectacular. I'm not sure that 'wired' was the intended primary mode of operation but it turns out that it's the way I'm going to use it most of the time.________________________________NOTE: The Boombox does not work with the Kindle Fire because the Fire does not have Bluetooth.","[0, 0]","Go wireless, young person",2012,01, 18,,2931,507,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20120118

I am not going to go into 'specs' because they are available at Amazon and at Samsung's own site (yes, there's Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi and so forth) but I will discuss my week-long experience of using it.I am not sure if 8.9"" is the sweet spot in tablets but it's good that, unlike a certain rival, Samsung is moving away form the 'one size must fit all' philosophy. I am personally okay with 10.1"" but the slightly smaller size may appeal to those who do a lot of on-screen thumb-typing. Also, since the resolution is the same 1280x800 you get a higher pixel density that improves on the 10.1"" impressive display.POSITIVES- Lighter - Smaller means a couple of ounces lighter. A possible advantage if you're using the Tab as a reader.- Super-responsive to touch, possibly even more so than the 10.1"" Tab.- Flash 10.2 is not only supported but it comes pre-installed - one thing not to worry about.- Samsung adds its own mini apps tray. In the end you pick your favorites from the market but some choice is always a positive.- Size, of course. Anyone who gets the 8.9"" picks it for its size so, again, choice.- Great forward and rear facing cameras, same as the 10.1""- Dual-core processor handles Honeycomb with ease and, hopefully, makes it a good candidate for a future ICS upgrade.- You can have the Android market and the Amazon Appstore installed.NEGATIVES- Memory can't be expanded due to lack of a microSD port (but 32GB should be sufficient)- No HDMI port either- Backside could be a little thickerRATINGI had the opportunity to use the 8.9"" Tab for one week, swapping our recently-upgraded ICS (Android 4) XOOM, mainly because a friend was eager to experience the 'new' Android. In the end, we were both favorably impressed with the other's tablet and agreed that we could live happily with either.While I understand that the some could miss an HDMI and an SD slot the reality is that my XOOM has them and the only time I actually used them was while testing my tablet. I did not miss them on the Tab during the week I had it for myself. I prefer the 10.1"" format myself but I must admit that the crisper display was quite attractive.In the end, the 'negatives' are not such a big deal.

Probably okay as a reading/viewing stand but smaller tablets may fall off when the Folio is in a carrying case configuration. Not safe. Case Logic has several sizes available so try the best match.Q: Is this a 'generic-looking' product.A: Yes. It is not a fashion statement.Q: Is the Folio made of leather?A: The outside appears to be a synthetic fabric with a faux leather band.Q: Does it look 'cheap'?A: No. The product's appears to be made of good quality (though not 'expensive') materials, probably ballistic nylon on the outside.Q: Is the tablet well protected inside?A: The Folio is well padded and it should be able to absorb a great deal of shock in a 'fall' situation.Q: Is it easy to set a tablet in?A: Yes. It takes about 5-10 seconds.Q: Is it easy to take the tablet out?A: Yes, a couple of seconds to pull out the 2 stabilizing clamps.Q: As a reading/viewing stand can I have my tablet in either portrait or landscape?A: No. It only supports landscape mode.Q: Does it allow for keeping/storing a stylus and a cleaning cloth?A: No. There are no extra pockets.Q: Will my tablet be held safely in position while reading/viewing or while I'm carrying it?A: Generally yes but you do have to make sure that the clamps are in place before you close it up.Q: When in 'carrying' mode, does the Folio use a lock?A: No. It is held closed by a strap, Moleskin-style.Q: Can I charge my tablet while held inside the Folio?A: If your charging port is on the side, yes even when the Folio is closed. If it's at the top or bottom, the Folio must be open.Q: Are there multiple viewing angles when in a reader configuration?A: The Folio allows for 2 viewing angles.Q: Was it made in China?A: Yes.Q: Is it heavy?A: Not if compared with some of the 'leather' alternatives.I am overall pleased with this product. Except for the clamps sometimes slipping off the corners (be careful and check before you close it up) and its lacking a hook or something for attaching a stylus, it's all good for a 'generic' product.

Anyone who spends a lot of time with a laptop while sitting on a couch and is bothered by the laptop's heat or wishes that there was a more ergonomically correct way may want to consider this product.And 'laptop stand' isn't the only possible use. I can see using CAAZORII's to hold a cookbook off the table, easier to read and protected from accidental spills or whatnot. Or as an improvised tabletop-sitting lectern. I'm sure there are many more practical uses.I am in fact writing this review on my laptop while sitting on the couch and, indeed, the CAAZORII makes it possible to do it and makes a trip to the desk unnecessary. Once the Lapdesk is in place with the laptop on top of it it's quite comfortable for as long as I stand still. If I had to use the laptop on and off this would not be a practical solution because, as comfortable the use may be while settled, the initial setup and the disentanglement are not quick or easy - take the laptop off Lapdesk while the Lapdesk is still on the couch with me sitting on it, then take the Lapdesk from under me and make sure that I don't get scratched by the undercarriage protrusions, then find some place for the Lapdesk to stand until the next laptop-use-on-the-couch session... Now, that I've been working on this review for the past 15 minutes or so I feel like I wanted to stretch my legs but I won't because I'd have to do what I just described above and then do it again in reverse when ready to resume.By the way, I am writing this review because the makers of this product - Made in USA - offered to send me a free unit and I agreed to give it a test drive. In other words, I didn't pay for it but I didn't promise a 'good review' and the makers of CAAZORII didn't ask or even imply that they expected one.If I was to organize my thoughts, this is what I like about this product:- addresses the laptop heat problem- enforces a better posture- many possible uses other than 'laptop stand'- easy to assemble and carry- 4 distinct configurations are possible- made in the USAThe not so good aspects are:- protrusions underneath the platform make use less comfortable that it should be- anyone with, let's say, thicker than average thighs may not be able to use this product- not a good solution if you are going to use your laptop on and offI will not comment on 'price' because prices change and because I understand that innovation deserves to be rewarded and, as a car salesperson told me once, the price is right if I (the individual buyer) decide it is so because the product fulfills my needs or expectations.I believe that 3 stars should be the fair rating for this product.

One of its ends is a 'mini' (Type C) connector that may be required by certain cameras such as the Flip MinoHD but is not compatible with 'regular' equipment. And do NOT confuse the 'mini' with the 'micro' (Type D) HDMI connector which is even smaller and works with the newest/smallest gadgets. Check your gadget's manual before you place your order. Tablets tend to require a 'micro' connector.B - You don't mind paying very little. If you search Amazon for 'HDMI mini' you will find quite a few similar items, some of them selling for a lot more but performing the exact same fashion.And, talking about specs, this cable is a 'High Speed' rated HDMI 1.4 cable 'with Ethernet'.- The 'High Speed' rating is largely meaningless, indicating that the cable supports 1080p video - almost all do and no one should ever consider buying anything less.- The 'with Ethernet' badge indicates that if the 2 connected devices support Ethernet AND support HDMI 1.4, they will be able to use the HDMI cable for Ethernet traffic instead of requiring a separate additional phone-like wire. Of course, none of the small cameras that would use a mini HDMI connector talk 'Ethernet' so this 'with Ethernet' feature doesn't really matter much.- 6 ft. length is just about right. The cable is long enough to allow for a connection to the back of your TV or receiver while the 'mini' end can be pulled to the front where your camera would plug. My new receiver came with a front HDMI port and a good-looking 6 ft. cable for playing video on the big screen from my camera is exactly what I needed.- It's pretty. Given that this is a visible HDMI cable, not something that goes to the back of your entertainment center, looking good adds value.I had no trouble to plug the mini end into my MinoHD and the regular into a our receiver and play video directly. Playback was flawless and, even though this is not something that everyone needs or anyone needs often, it doesn't hurt having one around.I am granting this cable 5 stars because it performs flawlessly, the price is absolutely right and for its premium looks.","[37, 38]","Price is right, looks good, performs flawlessly",2012,08, 19,0.9736842105263158,2165,384,Positive,37,38,1,0.023579221625142484,20120819

Dent ""Aragorn""",1336262400,5.0,B006YB9082,"05 6, 2012","The Linksys E3200  is, without a doubt, an impressive product. It's one VERY easy to set router that appears to operate reliably and even comes with a couple of notable bells and whistles. However, some of the 'high performance' claims proved to be slightly exaggerated and I wasn't impressed by the quality of user support.My experience with Cisco's refurbished equipment is that it's practically indistinguishable from 'new' except for less warranty coverage and support. Our E3200 performed flawlessly under heavy stress (supporting over 2 dozen devices) for one year already.SETUP (5 of 5)One question most of us ask ourselves before proceeding to set something as intimidating as a new router is 'will I be able to make it work for me?' The good news is that in this case the answer should be 'probably or most likely yes.' For a basic setup, you simply plug in the router, run the Cisco Connect app provided on a CD on a computer equipped with a Wi-Fi adapter and... you are connected.Cisco Connect is a well-organized app that will help you add devices to the network - and once the router is app and running most devices will add themselves once you provide the password - allow for limited 'guest' access on a separate network, set parental controls, test your Internet connection speed and directly manage your router if you need to split your network for better performance, configure DNS and DHCP, advanced wireless settings, security, manage the attached disk if you have one, set access policies and so forth.It gets as sophisticated as you need it to be and the good news is that both Cisco Connect and the router's Web interface are are well organized and are backed by a very well written and quite detailed manual. I will post the link to the downloadable PDF as a comment to this review.My basic setup completed in a couple of minutes and it took a couple of minutes more to register individual devices: laptops, desktops, printers, portable gaming devices, home servers, Internet radio. Anything that has a wired connection (4 10/100/1000 Mpbs ports are available) does not need any setup. The more sophisticated tasks, such as reserving IP addresses for printers and a media hub and 'splitting' the traffic into 2 separately named networks mapping into the router's 2 frequency bands (2.4 MHz and 5 MHz) were equally easy and well covered by the manual.It's important that Cisco Connect is installed on one of your computers if not on all because the first thing it does when you start it is checking the router's status and attempting to fix whatever problems if it detects any. To get 'the latest' I installed it from Cisco's site and I didn't experience any issues during or after the install completed.PERFORMANCE AND RANGE (4 of 5)Depending on your clients, the router can provide as much as 2 x 300 Gbps - this was a major improvement over the 802.11g router it's replacing. This is a lot considering that the best I am getting from my ISP is 15 Mbps downstream and 2 Mbps upstream but today's home networks have a lot of internal traffic if you use NAS devices, media servers or home servers that are set to run backups.While the router supports 802.11 a/b/g/n the manual warns that best performance can be achieved when all clients support 802.11n and that one single 802.11a client can slow the entire network if present.In practice I got consistent 150 Mbps on the 5 GHz band while in the same room at about 30 ft. from the router (except for a few minutes each day when the 5 GHz signal drops for no apparent reason - see the posted screenshots). With one floor in-between, 90 Mbps was possible but the 5 GHz band wasn't as reliable or I could get a steady stream of 54 Mbps, sometimes better on the 2.4 GHz band. With 2 floors in between (router in the basement and my computer on the second floor and at the other end of the house, some 70-80 ft. away) the 5 MHz band became practically unusable (I will post some inSSIDer shots) and the 2.4 GHz band would get me 6-24 Mbps, still okay for Web browsing. The computers on the second floor right above the router get a steady 50-70 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band.I would like to note that, while the router broadcasting on 2 bands does have its advantages the 5 GHz signal works best when you have line of sight to the router or one thin wall/floor in between. It's not as good at passing through walls as the 2.4 GHz signal. It is possible to maximize performance by using a combination of wired plus 2 segregated bands but some testing and good planning is needed.RELIABILITY (4.5 of 5)The E3200 has been remarkably stable so far if I don't consider the random signal loss on the 5 GHz frequency on the second floor. It's fair to state that, when the default settings are kept, the router will automatically switch between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and between the available channels on each band to maximize performance and minimize interference. Since I don't have neighbors, I can't say how the router would perform in a more crowded environment.Due to a number of violent storms, we lost power for seconds at a time several times in the past few days. Whenever that happened, the router came back on its own and I was able to resume work without having to reestablish a VPN connection or the chat session on WebEx with a Cisco support rep.EXTRA FEATURES (4.5 of 5)The E3200 is chuck-full of advanced features including strong security and encryption and the ability to optimize it for gaming (not tested yet) and, of course, the most visible being the USB port through which you can share files off an attached disk with control over access level on the local network and over the Internet.On my features wish list... I wish it was possible to actually control the signal strength because the 5 GHz band is clearly underpowered. Also, while it is possible to remotely reboot the router, it would have been nice if a physical 'off' switch was available.MY RATINGThis may not be the best n-router out there - Cisco does sell a higher model for a few dollars more - but I suspect it's all the way there at the top. I can't see how you can go wrong with this one. At the 'refurbished' price it can't be beat.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[13, 15]",Tops,2012,05, 6,0.8666666666666667,6223,1104,Positive,13,15,2,0.022765021983390327,20120506

I will first enumerate its features, then write a paragraph or two on my experience.&#10004; Weather band support: you can easily and manually tune into one of the 7 frequencies weather band frequencies that's best heard in your area&#10004; Weather alert mode: you set the Adventurer to actively 'listen' for weather alerts and turn itself on whenever one is received&#10004; Water resistant (NOT water proof)&#10004; Lanyard (already attached)&#10004; Rechargable battery can be removed or replaced if needed&#10004; USB cables and connectors for charging the Adventurer itself as well as charging other devices such as phones and playing back content off MP3 players&#10004; AM/FM bands with auto-scan&#10004; Clock (12Hr/24Hr modes)&#10004; Telescopic antenna&#10004; Flashlight: it's a 3-LED, quite bright and useful&#10004; Charging off a computer, generic AC/DC 4V USB charger, solar power or hand cranking&#10004; Charges a cell phone or any other device such as an MP3 player or even Kindle reader through generic Mini and Micro USB attachments provided or through your own proprietary cable&#10004; Plays your MP3 through provided cable&#10004; Crank: if you ever drain the battery and there's no way to charge it directly, a couple of minutes of cranking should get you 16-20 minutes of radio reception or about one hour of flashlight use or a few minutes of talk time if you use it to charge your cell phoneQuite a few feature. In real life, the Adventurer is something you are likely to use because you need to not because you want to. It's probably most useful during unsettled weather situations when you can set it in 'weather alert' mode. If the power and the Internet are down (no Wi-Fi) and you'd rather save your phone's battery for when you truly need it, the Adventurer will allow you to listen to your local radio stations and the national weather broadcasts without worrying much about wasting your battery charge because you can always crank it back to life if it runs out of it. Same on the flashlight. It's not the most powerful one in the world but it's something that you can use to find your way around the house and maybe save the really bright ones for true emergencies.Of course, the Adventurer has its limitations and they are not unexpected. It only remembers the last station you tuned in on each of the 3 bands, the solar charger is more of a gimmick than anything useful at all (you are not likely to store it in a sunlit place), the quality of the sound is decent if you don't mind 'mono' but nothing to crave for but, again, it does the job and this is what matters. I only wish it came with a case or organizer storage bag where the radio and all the little wire accessories could be stored together. I only wish it did NOT have a solar panel which adds very little to charging the unit and makes it a lot less rugged._______________________________________Note:The first comment to this review has a link to the product manual and the maker's FAQ for this product.","[0, 0]",Good to have around in a weather emergency or power outage situation,2013,04, 23,,3237,555,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20130423

This is okay for me because I'm a casual Vita player but it may be an issue for the more hard-core. On the other hand, the hard-core players may not need/want to use this at all. I noticed that our kid who's been using a PSP for the past couple of years appears to be quite comfortable with the Vita 'as is' - his reaction was 'oh... neat' but after using the grip a couple of times he didn't bother snapping it back in after he had to separate it from the Vita when changing a game.To conclude, this is a five-star item for me.

The one innovative or original feature is making one of the 2 charging ports a dedicated 'Apple' socket for quickly charging Apple devices only. Both USB charging ports work with either Apple or non-Apple hardware but the makers caution that charging a non-Apple device through the Apple port may not be as efficient as using the non-Apple port. It plugs into a wall outlet and, according to specs, it outputs as much as 2.1A when only one of the 2 USB ports is used, sharing it when they are used simultaneously. No cables are provided, meaning that you must have your own and they should work for as long as there is a standard USB-A connector at one end to plug it into the charger.This is what I like about the product:+ 2.1 Amps seems to be good enough to charge most 'small' electronics. Had no trouble charging small MP3 players, a PSP, Kindle e-readers and our Kindle Fire.+ Dedicated 'Apple' (for fast charging of Apple gadgets) and 'Not-Apple' ports for everything else.+ Supports 100-240V AC, meaning that it can travel to foreign countries but you may need a plug adapter there.+ Price appears to be in line with what most similar products sell for at Amazon.+ The small 1/4 page User Guide is well written and informative.+ Every device that's listed as chargeable and I tested did charge.But nothing is perfect:- The prongs don't fold, something we might expect from a device that's meant to travel.- Not all devices that match the charger's specs (but not on the list) actually charge or if they do they charge very, very slowly. I don't have the tools to measure the output at the other end of a USB wire but I suspect that the output may be something less than the claimed 2.1 Amps.Segregating the 2 ports into Apple/not-Apple makes the 'dual port' a more versatile 'one port' charger, which is okay. Anyone who owns both Apple and non-Apple chargeable Apple hardware should pick this charger as a great backup.Overall, the minor issues noted, this is a good backup charger with one interesting capability - the dedicated Apple port. It works well and, given that I've burned this one in for about 10 days, it should last for a while.NOTE: I initially rated this as a 4-star but I am upgrading it to a 5-star after successfully, simultaneously and quickly charging an iPhone through the Apple port and a Sansa Clip MP3 player through the 'other'. I see this charger as a 4-star for anyone who does not own Apple devices and a 5 star for those who do.","[0, 0]","Good, honest backup charger, especially if you own an Apple gadget",2012,08, 8,,2658,474,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20120808

With the Fire HD you can:+ watch Prime movies and shows for free, rent them or buy them and take advantage of Amazon's unlimited free cloud storage+ download and install Appstore's Android free apps of the day or get any of the thousands that are either free (ads supported) or inexpensive and, once purchased, Amazon lets you install them on all the Android tablets registered to your name, whether Fires or not and it even keeps them in the cloud for you for another day, should you decide to remove them+ store all your MP3 purchases in the cloud and play them from any device or bring them from the cloud into your own storage if you don't want to constantly stream stuff+ with the Fire HD as a reader, access your purchased Kindle books or borrow if you are a Prime member+ access trivia on actors and related trivia from IMDB from within a movie+ on certain e-books, get additional information, usually from Wikipedia on characters, sites or plot+ install and run some of the greatest apps and services on the Web including Netflix, Pandora, facebook and so forth+ the front-face camera/microphone makes Skype video calls possible+ HDMI-out (must provide your own cable) makes it possible to play any video on a big screen TV+ Bluetooth should allow the Fire HD to pair (not tested yet) with a number of interesting peripherals such as external speakers or keyboards+ email client brings in messages from Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, I believe Yahoo tooAnd there are things you can't do with your Kindle or the Kindle doesn't do very well because nothing can do everything:- lacking a GPS means well... you can't use your Fire HD for turn-by-turn directions- the browser is not that impressive, in fact it's pretty slow and... I do miss my Chrome when on the Fire HD- Amazon's Appstore is not bad but when it comes to Android apps Google Play is so much larger, I wish there was a way I could access them both like I can on my Nexus 7- I with there was a rear-facing cameraFEATURES AND FIRE HD vs. NEXUS 7I am most impressed by the display. It's a major improvement over the initial Fire and it's comparable to that of the Nexus 7.While no longer the only game in town for 7"" tablets, the HD is much more elegant-looking than the first generation Fire, the infamous power button was moved to the side and there are physical volume buttons now - I didn't miss them but I heard of many complaints.Battery life is on par with the Nexus. After a full charge I've run mine for over 8 hours worth of browsing, video playing and music plus a couple of Skype calls and there's still some juice left.A brief of Google's Nexus 7 is in order because these 2 tablets are similar in screen size and screen resolution and price and, given that you will have to buy a charger and maybe pay Amazon to turn off the ads and you'll find that the 16GB configuration are comparable when it comes to price too.To quickly compare them: the Nexus 7 has it almost all, including easy access to Amazon's Appstore, it can run the Kindle App and you could easily get to Amazon's cloud. It has features that the Fire HD lacks such as a 4-core processor, GPS, compass, Near Field Communication, it's likely to take any Android upgrade may be released in the next 2-3 years and it runs Chrome (my favorite browser) and a number of great Google services that Amazon refuses to allow on the Fire. Oh, and it doesn't come with ads.Does all of the above make the Nexus 7 the obvious choice for everyone when it comes to 7"" tablets? Not quite. I found myself a minority of one in our family when we voted on which tablets to acquire with everybody else picking a version of Fire, because the first gen Fire was such a hit with our little girl and the second generation is so much sweeter. The Nexus is capable and feature-rich and infinitely-customizable but that's not what 'they' were looking for. They wanted in a tablet something that delivers content and does it quickly and seamlessly and... that's the Fire HD and the new and improved Fire so we ordered one of each.LAST WORDSI already discussed why I am rating the Fire HD a four-star but let me recap it as briefly as I possibly can:* great for Amazon stuff* major improvement over the initial Fire* 7"" seems to be the ideal form factor for a tablet dedicated to content delivery (not creation)* price is not as low as it seems - must buy charger, maybe pay Amazon to stop pushing ads (I won't because they no longer bother me)* ads can be annoying to some (see above, they are invisible to me now)* Nexus 7 beats the HD hands down on features/performance but the Fire HD may be the better 'package' for most* the comprehensive parental control features promised for the Fire HD in October are a major, Kindle exclusive that could tip the balance heavily toward the Fire in any household where the tablet is to be shared with childrenAnd one last word on the 16GB vs. 32GB. We went for the 16GB because, 2 years later, our 16GB XOOM is still only a little over half full and we use it to shoot videos, take photos and it has many dozens of apps installed. Unless you are planning to store large photo and music libraries, 16GB should be enough but, of course, if spending a few extra dollars is not an issue, more storage is always better.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[3, 3]",On Fire (hands on),2012,09, 14,1.0,8018,1385,Positive,3,3,0,0.022504478098029638,20120914

With the Range Extender (it's a wireless repeater) plugged into a wall outlet on the first floor I am now getting 4-5 bars consistently and about 65Mbps. Problem solved.I am happy with my purchase because the RE1000 finally solves a problem and it's one thing I will not have to worry about and because it's one of the easiest to set up 'networking' gadgets I know of. So, these are the facts and my experience.WHAT YOU GET* The RE1000 Range Extender itself* CD that has the setup utility and the manual* AC cord, just in case you don't want to plug it directly into the wall outlet* AC power connector cover* A short Ethernet cable that may be needed for setupWHAT ELSE YOU NEED* A wireless b/g/n router, obviously* PC or Mac with Wi-Fi and a CD drive to run the setup* Some Web browser to run the more sophisticated setup and administration activitiesSETUP AND INSTALLATIONIt's as easy as running the Setup program. After a minute or so you are asked to plug the device into a power outlet somewhere near the router for it to be 'discovered'. That's done quickly and the RE1000 is ready to use by plugging it directly into a wall outlet or you can use the supplied cord.More sophisticated admin tasks can be performed through a browser. You will need to know RE1000's IP address for that to work. Through your favorite Web browser, you can associate your device with a specific access point or router and determine signal strength at various locations to determine your extender's optimal placement.There are more options but none was needed with our CISCO router and it should be the case with most b/g/n routers.RATINGI wish that all 'electronics' were this easy and efficient. Once the 5-minute setup is done you can plug this anywhere in the house (within your router's range) and it will just work. We happened to have a stormy day yesterday and we lost power several times - not an uncommon occurrence - and every time the RE1000 reconnected itself to the router once the power came back and did its magic without requiring any human intervention. This is near-zero maintenance device that addresses the source of major frustrations.This is a five-stars without hesitation._________________________________________________Update July 3, 2013One star goes off for the horrible customer service.

You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4 such as TVs and Blu-ray players. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future such as a 3D Blu-ray player.Keep in mind that BOTH connected devices need to support the HDMI 1.4 standard for this cable to make a difference and that it is NOT possible to upgrade any existing equipment (TV, Blu-ray player) to support HDMI 1.4. This being said, I would not buy an HDMI cable unless it was v1.4 given that the price difference is insignificant or non-existent.HOW GOOD IS IT?On my equipment, this worked as well as any older HDMI 1.3 cable. It replaced an older HDMI v1.3 wire at the back of my entertainment center and, nothing unexpected happened. The picture on my TV was as beautiful as before.Briefly, this cable:- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.A 5-star rating should be fair for this cable because it is fully HDMI 1.4/1.3x and the price is right.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 is a HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable supports the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' makes sense and is emerging as the common HDMI 1.4 cable standard.'Standard' cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i) and I am not aware of such products on the market. High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[0, 0]","Full-featured HDMI, price is right",2012,08, 20,,4906,817,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20120820

At the same time, it allows for a lot of flexibility to take advantage of its many features and capabilities. Besides Wi-Fi clients, the N600 supports up to 4 wired connections plus a storage device attached via USB.Given that this 'appears' to be a basic router, my first test was 'how far could I go without manuals or documentation of any kind.' After I powered off the existing router I plugged in the My Net N600, used the supplied (yellow) Ethernet cable to connect to the cable modem, another cable to connect to a media server and I USB-attached an HDD. Then, I pressed the 'power' button. My computer immediately showed a new, unsecured Wi-Fi network. 10 seconds later I was surfing the Net.The title of this review is what you need to remember if you are to properly set up your router. What I did in the first paragraph works and it works immediately but must of us are going to require some minimal level of security and tweaking a setting or two. The good news is that the basic setup through your browser is a breeze. It only takes a few minutes to rename your network and to set it with strong security. Another couple of minutes and the USB-connected hard disk was shared and could be accessed from my any other computers. Almost everything else works well with the defaults but... this is what my 15-minutes or less custom setup consisted on, tab by tab. Depending on what you require from your router, your experience may be different._________________________________________________WANNothing to do here, stay with the defaults and you should be okay in most instances.WIRELESSUnder 'Wireless Setup', since this is a dual-band router, it's up to you whether you create two networks for the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz bands or you merge them by assigning the same names and passwords to both bands. It's also where you set the security level - go with the highest if your other devices support it. I assigned the same network name and password to both bands and set security to WPA/WPA2.LANStay with the defaults unless you want to change your router's name to something other than MyNetN600. I extended the DHCP access range under DHCP Server Settings  to 192.168.1.254 because we have quite a few devices that are going to interact with the router in our house so 155 possible address allocations are better than the default 50.Note that if you go to Device and Client Tables you can see all the computers connected to your router at any given time.STORAGENothing to do here unless you attach a hard disk to the N600. I did and I confirmed that it was treated as a 'public share' so it wasn't going to prompt me for a user ID and password to access it and everyone else in the house could access it.SECURITYNot much to do here unless you want to set up you own router-based firewall or you want to set up your own DMZ. If you're not sure how this is done (I'm not) then don't bother. The Parental Controls section is something that I may come back and explore later. My existing router, a Linksys allows me to deny Internet services to specific devices at specific times of the days on specific days of the week. This router's appears to rely on some outside filtering service. Something worth investigating.ADDITIONAL FEATURESUnless Port Forwarding, ALG, Routing, FasTrak QoS and Network UPnP are meaningful concepts to you, you're better off to stay away from this and keep the defaults. You may want to look at FasTrak QoS because this is where you can set priorities for your various apps. All I did there was changing Netflix to highest priority. Didn't have to change anything else.ADMINYou can do a lot here or you can do nothing if you decide to stay with the default settings. You may want to change the router access password to something other than the default 'password' setting. There are sections worth exploring such as usage logs but you don't have to._________________________________________________With the setup as above I then plugged in my Vonage (VoIP) box, a powerline adapter (Ethernet over power lines) and connected a Wi-Fi signal booster. I had no trouble VPN-ing to my workplace and doing a video conference call there while one of our kids was playing a game online, someone else in the house was on the phone, our little girl was watching Netflix on her Kindle Fire and Pandora was playing on another tablet.The N600 deserves its 5 stars for being so easy to set and use and for its many features and capabilities, all offered at an affordable price. Unless you have a super-busy home network, this should come close to the perfect router these days. For a little more internal bandwidth, WD has a higher end device.","[45, 49]",192.168.1.1,2012,07, 30,0.9183673469387755,4826,845,Positive,45,49,4,0.023742061553492916,20120730

The near-complete dominance of the one-size-fits-all, general-purpose tablet is about to end and more of us have the ability to pick something that more closely matches what we want or what we need in the favorite feature set, screen size and level of affordability. And the Note 10.1 is one such example. It's not for everyone but if you are looking for a highly portable tool to not only consume content or shop or play games but also to create media, especially visual media, the Note 10.1 is probably the best choice at this time.SPECSNothing to be shy about when it comes to powerful hardware.- 1.4GHz quad-core CPU (fast)- 2GB of RAM- WXGA display, 1280 x 800 LCD (not the best but good enough)- 16/32GB built-in storage- MicroSD for further storage expansion- USB 2.0- mHL port for directly connecting to HD TVs- Bluetooth 3.0 for connecting any of a number of possible peripherals such as speakers or keyboards- Wi-Fi 802.11N- Wi-Fi Direct (connect to other devices without the need of a wireless access point- 1.9M front camera- 5M rear camera- stereo speakers (impressive)Performance is impressive. Response is almost immediate, the tablet responds well to either finger, stylus or its own pen. As the enumeration above shows, this tablet has almost everything and most of it is top notch. Yes, you can find better displays on other tablets but I am quite content with what the Note provides.THE PENThe difference the pen makes is the difference between finger painting and using a fine paintbrush or pencil. The Note's pen allows for precise control, the tablet responds to its touch instantly and with the proper software you can do more neat things with it than you can possibly imagine before you actually try it. I found the pen to be comfortable to hold and it's the preferred input method for the Note.If you want to do any serious drawing or painting on a tablet, the Note 10.1 is likely to be the number one choice, thanks to its S Pen. It's a lot more than a stylus. Its thin tip allows you to touch the screen with almost pixel-level precision and the the tablet recognizes not only the tip's position but also the amount of pressure you apply. This makes all the difference when it comes to drawing or painting. Additional capabilities are unlocked in S Pen-aware apps trough by pressing a button on the pen's side.SOFTWAREIt's impressive how well integrated Samsung's own apps and customized interface blend with the base Android foundation. Samsung's interface and the 4-core processor allow you to truly multitask - as in have 2 apps sharing the screen - certain compatible apps. For example, you can play a video on one half of the screen and run a browser and do your email on the other half.The Note shines when running Samsung developed or third-party apps that are S Pen compatible. There's quite a few of them including an amazing custom version PhotoShop Touch. Samsung's own S Note allows you to take hand-written notes, can guess many basic shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) that you may try to draw and replace them with perfect outlines. There's a number of S Pen apps on Google Play.One of the more intriguing apps was Kno Textbook aimed at students whose titles come with full multimedia features, from illustration to animations, 3-D models and video and they claim to have thousands of titles available for purchase.WHO SHOULD CONSIDER IT?Anyone who can afford the price and is an artist by profession or by hobby should at least consider the Note 10.1. Students may be interested because of the tablet's note-taking capabilities and the Kno Textbook app. Also, anyone who, like me, doesn't particularly enjoy touching their tablet screen.I will be rating the Note 10.l as a five-star in the context of it providing the specific features and capabilities I described below. As a general-purpose tablet is simply one of many - good quality build if you don't mind all-plastic, powerful specs at the time I write this but may not look so powerful one year from now, likely to get Android upgrades eventually.

They never suggested that a 'good' review was expected in exchange and in this case the three stars mean ""It's Okay"" but only barely.Starting with the good features:- STEREO. Small as it is, the AYL is actually stereo. There are 2 little speakers and they do produce something that can be called 'stereo' sound.- TOUCH CONTROLS. The topside lights up when touched and I was able to control the volume and even skip forward on some of the more compliant apps. There is no visual feedback though, you keep tapping until the volume decreases or increases to the desired level.- EASY BLUETOOTH PAIRING. For reasons I don't fully understand, some of the little Bluetooth speakers I received for review recently had trouble pairing with some or sometimes all the devices I tried them on. Not the AYL. It happily paired with everything and it did it so quickly.- ANALOG audio interface and cable included.- BAG also included, very nice.But not all is great with the AYL, beginning with the sound quality.- POOR SOUND. It's not always terrible and the speakers seem to be handling the mid range pretty well but the bass is struggling big time and the acutes occasionally turn into a hard to accept screech or hiss. Listening to the AYL can be painful. So, yeah, if you're buying the speakers 'for the sound', maybe the AYL is not the best option out there unless your favorite music lacks bass and acutes. This is where about 2.5 stars come off.- MINOR THINGS. A little manual or 'how to use it' sheet with fonts larger than 'microscopic' and without misspelled words would have helped. And, related, some hints on how to handle incoming and outgoing phone calls if paired with a phone.Overall, I am not sure if I should recommend the AYL. There are much better little speakers 'out there' but, to be fair, they also tend to be anything from a little to a lot more expensive. Price is what saves the AYL from a two-star rating. Speaking for self, I'd rather save a few more dollars and buy something that I could listen to happily but I understand that compromises have to be made sometimes.

I'd say get yourself one and... you may never need it or... some day you may be happy you had with you.By default it acts as an access point and you don't need to do much to make it work other than connecting it to a wired network. The default network name and password are printed on the back and all you need to do is enter them for the devices you'd like to use it. It's as simple as that.To use in as a signal booster or a bridge (create an additional wireless network) or as a wireless adapter for a device that supports Ethernet but does not support wireless you will need to actually read the manual but it's not that difficult. Out of curiosity, before reading the manual, I called the tech support with questions on connecting my Ethernet-only receiver to wireless and they guided me through the steps and made it work for me.To make brief, this is what I believe the Nano Router is worth getting, even if you don't need it immediately but for 'just in case' situations:- In its default configuration is super-easy to set up as a hotspot.- It's small enough for two of these to fit in your shirt pocket, not that you'd want to keep them there.- Non-default setup is relatively easy and it can do things that several dedicated devices would be needed otherwise.- Good backup worth keeping around - imagine if your router died and you needed Wi-Fi immediately.- All cables and even an external charger are included (not bad for something selling at this price)The Nano is not going to be my primary router or signal booster but I will always keep it in my travel bag, just in case","[0, 0]","Found its place in my travel bag, just in case",2013,04, 23,,1769,331,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20130423

We don't allow her to use in-ear headphones and Ampz are the first pair she tried that combine super-cool looks with a crisp, quality sound rendition, quite unexpected from on-ear headphones within this price range.THE LOOKS (red/white model)The Ampz are style at least as much as they are function. The futuristic retro design - think Mystery Science Theater 3000 - looks better in 'reality' than on Amazon's page. The white and read faux leather plus chrome combination is just perfect for as long as it matches the wearer's style. There is some soft padding on the headband that thickens it and together with the extra-long red cord give the ensemble a 'fashion statement' kind of look.OPERATIONThe Ampz are as plain as they come. There are no controls of any kind, you just plug them in and they work, controlled by your device. They are advertised to be compatible with iPad/iPhone/iPod and Android devices but I suspect that they work with just everything that supports a 3.5mm jack. We tested them with a couple of tablets and laptops and our daughter is using them now with her Kindle Fire.The adjustable headband makes the headphones easy comfortable to wear and should accommodate just about any head size from child to adult.The sound is not professional quality but it's just fine if you are going to use the Ampz mainly to listen to Pandora and YouTube. They do come with a 40mm driver and they sound just fine except maybe for the bass which is a little lacking. I will do another sound-quality check in few weeks because many headphones sound quality improves after a break-in period that may last 100-200 hours.MY EVALUATIONThe Ampz look good and they sound good enough given the price to earn their five stars in spades. It should be noted that I am rating them from their intended user point of view and they are not targeted at adults. I would not, ever use/wear them but it is now hard to separate our little girl from her Ampz. Sometimes it only takes a little to make a little one happy.

And I upgraded my rating even thou cloud services is not something I am going to use at this time (prefer to keep my private network private). Here are my impressions.EASY INSTALL (4 out of 5) - To me easy installation is to be able to plug in the required wires, turn on the power and have a Wi-Fi network ready to use in about one minute. Routers such as Western Digital's MyNet N600 and Cisco's Linksys E- and EA- series meet my expectations. The N300 is almost there. I had to enter a password and then go through some installation routine that culminated to D-Link suggesting that I opened a D-Link account. In the end, it all turned out alright but it did take some 10 minutes before I could access the Net.SETUP (3 out of 5) - The admin interface is not the best laid out (still couldn't find the DHCP section) or the friendliest in the world but most of what I was looking for was there and did find it eventually, from storage sharing (of a USB attached HDD) to QoS settings. Again, not the friendliest but it does the job.FEATURES (4 out of 5) - The N300 appears to try to differentiate itself by being cloud-oriented. D-Link provides Dynamic DNS (DDNS) services which should allow users to get right into their home network and access anything there from anywhere. I have no reason not to trust D-Link but I have no compelling reason to further expose my private network to security breaches. Getting through a camera via DDNS is one thing, getting to 'everything' is something that I don't need and I don't feel comfortable with at this time. Besides the 'cloud' part, all basic features expected in a router are there. One important feature I couldn't find was something explicitly labelled 'parental controls'. The router does allow controlling access at certain times for specific devices but 'doable' has degrees and in this case it's not something easy to achieve.PERFORMANCE (5 out of 5) - Without any special setup everything on my home network was able to successfully use the router. That included my VoIP box, all wired and wireless devices from computers, laptops, Internet radios to Kindles, tablets, phones and portable gaming devices. I was able to get to my office over VPN and I was able to get Netflix on a tablet. The router handled well me doing VPN on my laptop while someone else was watching a movie on a tablet and one of our kids was playing some game on line.DOCUMENTATION - (4 out of 5) - The quick setup is easy to follow but it wasn't immediately clear where the more detailed manuals were. There is no CD in the box but I was able to find a comprehensive 160-page .pdf at the D-Link site.In the end, this is not the router I'd pick if I was shopping for one today and it may not be the one I'm going to keep as my 'main' router. Not because it's a terrible device because it's not, in fact it's quite good. It's just that there are routers out there that I'm more comfortable with that offer features (parental controls, ability to write to attached storage) that this one lacks or does not implement well, better performance at least in theory (dual band) and are easier to use and operate. However, anyone who needs the ability to access their home network from 'anywhere' should consider this device.","[1, 1]",Better than 'first impression' suggested,2012,08, 14,1.0,3480,623,Neutral,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20120814

It's light because what appears to be the metal case is thin enough not to add much to its weight but, at the same time, it's reasonably protective. It also comes with a lot of storage capacity. For a sense of scale, a 1TB is sufficient to store more than 150 DVD-quality movies or 200,000 songs or pictures.The drive powers itself off one USB 2.0 or (preferably) 3.0 port, 1-foot USB cable provided and it's as plug-and-play as they come. You plug it in and, a few seconds later it's recognized by your computer and ready to use.The disk came formatted as NTFS and a Seagate folder with some registration utilities was present. I was able to successfully reformat and use it as exFAT, FAT32 and then back as NTFS without a glitch. It worked well when attached through a USB 2.0 port as well as a USB 3.0 with the expected performance gain over the USB 3.0 interface.As for uses, I am going to attach it to a media server that backs up other devices on our home network but I could see it being shared through a router that supports USB-attached HDDs or even as a way to bring along data on the road if a much smaller 32/64GB flash drive is not large enough.When it comes to rating a product that I received to review one question I am asking myself is: 'knowing what I know now, would I buy this product?"" and in this case the answer is 'yes' because this HDD performs in the exact way I expected it. I find it a little too big in both physical size and capacity for it to be 'portable' as in travel portable but it could clearly be used that way. As a stationary drive it's well suited for backups or as an 'expansion', perhaps hanging off a laptop's docking station. It's got to be a five-star for meeting all my expectations.________________________________________________________And... yes, the warranty. It's 1 year in the US, 2 years if you happen to buy it in Europe. I personally tend to care about warranty on anything that costs $200 or more. If an $80 drive fails my true worry would be the lost data - hopefully there is a backup somewhere but Seagate will attempt to recover your data as a separate, paid service. As for the drive itself, the sheer investment in time and aggravation to get a replacement - providing proof of purchase, prove that you didn't use the drive commercially or that it wasn't damaged by some electrostatic discharge or by you stepping on it or squeezing it too hard, find the original package (Seagate hopes that you do), pay for shipping, wait for who knows how long for the replacement to arrive... usually not worth it. My experience is that if an 'electronics' device works for the first couple of weeks it's not likely to break or stop working any time soon.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[0, 0]",Great generic 1TB HDD which is what most of us need as an 'expansion',2012,09, 25,,2911,533,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20120925

The longevity of the game is very much worth it as well for buyers that are looking for the most for their dollar.

Once you exhaust that, there's are DLCs in the Playstation Store to get you even more songs.On the gameplay side of things the interface succeeds well at showing you the dance movies are coming next but it is the same standards that in most modern dancing games, nothing new there.

The promised candy included some encryption software that presumably was going to be installed if I became a member of the Club and 2GB of cloud storage offered by some third-party. It was easy to make a decision and my decision was 'no thanks'. Encryption tools are widely available and I can easily do without yet another tiny amount of 'free' cloud storage offered by some unknown provider. Deleting everything from the Extreme liberated some 3GB of storage so now I have the full 32GB available for use on a drive formatted as FAT32.What's left is a positively excellent flash drive that is fast, doing 25 MB/s writes from the internal HDD even through a USB 2.0 on my old T400 laptop. On a gaming PC it did 70-80 MB /s writes through a USB 3.0 interface from the internal HDD. This is a little lower than advertised but it's high enough to make me happy. And there are some other good reasons besides raw speed for me to be happy with the Extreme:- The retractable, spring-activated connector is the best of its kind I know of. It snaps in place when extended and it stays there.- The blue activity light is small and it's not annoying to the point of lighting up the room, something seen in other flash drives.- It actually looks cool.- Comes with a hole that makes it attachable to a key chain.There aren't any negatives I can think of other than whatever may be thrown your way IF you install the Club SanDisk software but you do it at your own risk and it's your decision to do so - at least on my computer it did not attempt to self-install.Anyone seeking an elegant, solid, roomy, speedy flash drive should seriously consider the 32GB Extreme. I took off a star because not everyone may realize, and SanDisk doesn't tell that buyer that you don't HAVE to install the provided software and that it's perfectly Okay to remove it.","[0, 0]",Can't get much better than this (if you first get rid of the pre-installed software),2012,08, 21,,2104,381,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20120821

It has the ability to control everything physically connected to it and it seamlessly reaches out to other devices on our home network and beyond, to the Internet. The temptation to go over every single feature I am aware of is strong but receivers have become complex, multi-featured machines and there's a 140 manual that does that. I will therefore talk about what the HR-RC460 did as I tested it and what I found impressive or not so much, useful or less so, feature-rich or overwhelmingly complex or complicated. This could mean that I may not speculate about features that some may find worth discussing at some length and accept it as inevitable but I wasn't able to test hands-on. My hope is that the setup I used for my test drive is not unlike what most typical users are likely to have.The HT-RC460 was as a 7.1 surround system. I did not set a second zone. Directly attached to it via HDMI were a TV, a satellite box, a WD media hub, a Blu-ray/DVD player and a gaming console with the last three having their own Ethernet connections. A security camera system was attached through a component video cable. The receiver was connected to the Internet via a Ethernet cable which in turn talks to a router over the power lines. The receiver and everything hard-wired to it were set to be operated with a Harmony universal remote control.FIRST IMPRESSIONSRight out of the box, Onkyo's receiver is not unlike the one (by Sony) I've been using for the past 4 years:- 7.2 surround: one extra woofer and speakers of anything between 6-16 Ohms- 2 zones- supports nearly all types of I/O: composite video and analog audio, coax, optical, HDMI (more ports with 8 in, 2 out, the higher v1.4), AM and FM antennae.- numerous sound processing modes with some new ones such as Dolby Pro Logic IIz and DTS Neo:6 decoding- video resolution beyond 1080p to cover 3D and 4K (the resolution used in movie theaters)And if the above appear to be only minor enhancements or features (4K video?) that no one is likely to need in the next 5 years, here are some brand new capabilities that should easily justify upgrading from an older model.- Front USB and HDMI ports- Ethernet- DLNA- Overlaid on-screen menusWhether the above are significant upgrades it depends on each individual's needs. I will discuss them below and explain why they matter to me. What follows is my experience with the product during my week-long test drive.PACKAGING AND CONTENTSBesides the receiver's body I found a CD that holds the manual as a .pdf file, the remote control and its 2 AA batteries, the AM/FM antennae and the special-purpose mic with a very long wire used to calibrate the speakers. This receiver does not come bundled with speakers or speaker wires or any other accessories.The contents are well protected inside the box and I know that they are so because UPS subjected the package to some extremely rough treatment and yet everything inside turned out to be Okay.INSTALLATIONNo, it wasn't easy and it took q while to get things going but Onkyo providing a set of sticky, color-coded labels for the speaker wires helped a lot my connecting a set of 7.1 existing speakers to the new receiver.Some of the HDMI inputs are pre-labeled as Cable/Satellite, Game, DVD, Computer and that made setting the HDMI connections easier.Once the wiring is done the receiver can automatically calibrate the speakers using the supplied, special-purpose calibration mic. A full auto-calibration round completes in less than 10 minutes.If the box was connected to the network it's likely through the Ethernet wire it will suggest a firmware update.then... there are many paths.You may complete the setup using the provided remote control and the receiver's own display or you may take advantage of the on-screen menus feature which is a lot more efficient. The on-screen menus make it easy to integrate the receiver into an universal remote control. I am currently using it with a Harmony 900 -  it doesn't know of the HT-RC460 but selecting HT-RC360 was close enough. Alternatively, I can use an Android tablet with the Onkyo remote app installed and I do use it, especially when I play content off the Internet or other devices on my home network but more about that later.My setup didn't take advantage of some of the more advanced features that HDMI 1.4 implements such us the Ethernet channel that would allow the receiver to share its Internet link with other connected devices such as network-capable TVs, Blu-ray or media hubs or the audio return channel that can send the audio signal from a playback device such as the TV back to the receiver.OPERATIONThe word of the day is 'flexibility', or you can be as sophisticated as you care or dare or you can let the receiver do what it thinks it's best for you and probably get 95% of what you would if you spent hours tweaking and trying out settings individually. The manual enumerates everything, feature by feature and there are many features, some very useful, quite a few such us image adjustments, redundant. The other word of the day is comprehensiveness.When it comes to audio, Onkyo's receiver supports just about any standard in existence and it will do its best to provide you with the optimal output. You can set it all to 'auto' or you can tell it what to do whether you are listening to music, playing a game or watching a movie. You can tweak with individual speakers. Same for video. I don't have a TV that displays 4K resolution (does anybody?) but, if I had one, the receiver would have allowed upscaling the 1080p to match that resolution. You can play with individual settings all you want and if the end-result doesn't look nearly as good as the defaults you can quickly revert back to the default settings and then try it again from there.I'm using a Harmony and I didn't try it myself but the remote control has the capability to control everything at the entertainment hub. The manual explains how to do it and has hundreds of codes for the various brands and models.FEATURESLike for most receivers, dealing with HD TVs, cable or satellite boxes, Blu-ray players and gaming devices is 'base business', especially when they are connected through HDMI. Onkyo's HT-RC460 does it well and so do most other receivers. But this is not all that Onkyo does.But then you connect the HT-RC460 to your home network and a world of new possibilities opens up.While AM and FM radio are still supported, Onkyo's receiver can and will get your local Internet-broadcasting stations. The vTuner service will get you that but you can also play any station in the world and you can search by location (continent/country/city), genre (available inside each country as well), popularity and so forth. I had no idea until a couple of days ago that my favorite Electronica radio was broadcasting from Romania.But that's not all. Besides radio stations, HT-RC460 supports a number of services, including my favorite, Pandora which comes loud and clear and so far commercials-free. Other services include SiriusXm, Slacker, AUPEO!, last.fm, Spotify, MP3tunes, Rhapsody and I suspect that additional ones may be added through future firmware upgrades.But... wait, there's more. HT-RC460 supports DLNA. Without getting into details, DLNA allows the receiver to 'see' and play content from any DLNA-compliant device on my home network which includes computers, dedicated home server, a WD media hub and... there's more :)I downloaded Onkyo'd remote control app from Google Play (not available at Amazon's Appstore) and... now my Android tablets and phones can act as remote controls for the receiver. But that's not all. With the app installed I can easily play anything that's on the tablet or phone and, of course, everything the receiver discovers through DLNA. So, imagine this: your tablet will find your favorite song somewhere on a computer in the house and tell your receiver to play it in 7.2 surround through your favorite decoder and this is easily done because all media is nicely indexed and can be searched by artist, album or title. But there's no need to imagine because it's true. And while that's happening, your phone or tablet can adjust the sound quality on the fly from anything simple like telling the receiver to optimize the sound for 'music' to setting the exact decibel level on individual speakers. And, of course, your tablet or your TV or both will display information on what's playing, including an image of the album cover. The remote control app is also available for iPods/Pads, by the way.And there are more features. If playing your tablet or phone content can't be done over Wi-Fi, you can easily connect them to the receiver via the HDMI or USB. There is one of each, easily accessible on the front. You can also play off a USB flash drive and, of course, you can easily browse or search the contents.I suspect that there are many other features I didn't notice or I didn't find to be interesting enough to mention here but someone else would view as very important but I'm going to stop because there's the big .pdf manual that discusses almost everything.PROS AND CONSThe big pros for this receiver are, in my view:- Seamless network/Internet integration that unlock so many interesting features and capabilities- On-screen (and it can be TV or phone or tablet screen) menus which overlay over the existing video display.- Extreme flexibility in configuration from the 'let Onkyo figure it out for me' level to very detailed tweaking.As for cons. Well... the manual is not the most user-friendly in the world but I can live with that. The Android remote control app while great and very easy to use needs an urgent update because the 'phone' resolution does not scale well on a 10-inch tablet and it seems to prevent the Android device from going to sleep even when the app is not in the foreground. Also, the warranty is a little too restrictive and appears to discourage on-line purchases - see below.MY RATINGWarranty-related issues aside, I am very pleased with this receiver. It does everything I expect from a receiver and then it does more and better. In other words, it exceeded my expectations which qualifies it for a 5 stars with flying colors rating._________________________________________________WARRANTY AND SUPPORTI did not weigh in warranty and service when I rated the receiver as a 5 star. Depending on where you buy your receiver from a brick and mortar dealer or online, you may be very happy with Onkyo's warranty or less so.The receiver's warranty is for 2 years, parts and labor which is a good thing. There are lots of exclusions, nothing unusual, ranging from you altering the product, it being damaged by things connected to it or you using it for commercial purposes. If you bought this online or you are planning to do so, consider the following:- Save your receipt AND the original box because you are going to need them both if you are to ship the receiver for warranty repairs.- Onkyo's warranty only covers units purchased from an authorized dealer. Onkyo considers Amazon to be authorized dealer but... don't forget: receipt, box.- My understanding is that you will be paying for shipping the receiver to Onkyo but they will be covering shipping when returning the box back to you.- There are no quick replacement/cross-shipping provisions so be prepared to do without if your receiver breaks down and needs repair.- If, after reading the above you are concerned about warranty service you should consider purchasing your receiver from a 'brick and mortar' authorized dealer because then all you need to do is take the box back to the dealer and you won't have to worry about paying for shipping and keeping the original box.Onkyo made a great receiver but they should consider improving their support for online purchases because other sellers of electronic devices do much better. When a monitor and a rather large laptop I purchased online broke both makers sent me a box and a pre-paid shipping label. I understand why the makers of complex devices would rather have us buy from dealers, because they don't need to worry about direct user support, but online purchases are a reality and other makers of electronics provide much better/friendlier support to their online customers.---------->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[75, 81]",Five Stars with Flying Colors (if warranty is not factored in),2012,08, 25,0.9259259259259259,12429,2108,Positive,75,81,6,0.024653965152255333,20120825

It's a very close match to what I needed for a small bedroom TV that's limited to 720p.This Roku, about the size of a small box of sardines took about 2 minutes to install - connected to the TV with an HDMI wire (not supplied) and plug it in. The initial setup was another 10 minutes - pick the house Wi-Fi network and enter the password, pick a few obvious channels such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pandora, set up an account and give Roku a credit card and name/address info.Then... it's done. I can assign more channels either directly or from Roku's Web site accessed through any computer and I can easily drop any of the channels I don't like. The interface is not the greatest in the world but it works. Once you get your favorite channels and drop the ones you are not likely to access the Roku blends into your 'entertainment center' environment and it's always there when you need it, literally, because there is not 'off' switch - Roku does go into some sort of sleep mode if you switch your TV to some other input or you are at the menu screen for too long but it wakes up the moment you touch the remote and it appears to stay connected.So, here is what I like about it:- Has an enormous amount of channels to choose from, including most popular ones.- It's very easy to set up, anyone can do it in minutes.- Very smooth streaming. Quite impressive considering that the Roku is on the second floor, some 60-70 ft. and two floors away from our Wi-Fi router located in the basement.- Small size.- Easy to operate through a very basic remote control.- Inexpensive.But nothing is perfect so, here are the negatives:- No Youtube. I'm sure there's a good reason for its absence but I wish it will appear some day. Everyone carries Youtube so why doesn't Roku?- Not too many live video streaming channels. Yes, it has a lot of 'on demand' services where you select whatever it is you want to watch but I wish there were some live 'news' channels such as C-Span which, by the way, is streaming live on the Net on 3 video and one audio channel and none is on Youtube.- The interface is okay but it could be improved.Overall, I'm reasonably happy with what I got and a Roku should be a good pick for a 'bedroom' TV where more sophisticated gear generally associated with the living room's entertainment center would be overkill.","[6, 7]",For Those About To Roku (We Salute You),2012,12, 19,0.8571428571428571,2458,452,Positive,6,7,1,0.02256961406936981,20121219

It's made of thick leather that should last and the material's thickness combined with the elastic straps holding the 4 corners keeping the tablet safely attached should offer reasonable protection if the case is ever dropped. As for 'stylish', that's largely in the eye of the beholder - I personally liked the metallic teal finish and the velvety lining interior. And this is where the 'positive' ends.The first thing I noticed as I took the case out of its packaging was a small 'finish' defect. The metallic teal had either peeled off or never stuck to a small section of the cover - was it spray painted? Then, there are some issues with functionality. It's true, the makers' stated goal did not include 'functional' or 'practical' as their objectives but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't expect such quality as implied features. And here are some of the issues I found with the cover:- it's heavy - perhaps the thick leather adds to the level of protection but it also makes the Fire plus Tribeca case  combo a rather heavy pair- it's thick - see above- the locking design - thick leather tab - does not close the folio well because the thick leather its made of does not like being bent too much and it runs into some reinforced seams on the back when folded out of the way while in viewing stand mode- the claim of 'multiple viewing angles' when set as a stand is not true, there is exactly one viewing angle- the Kindle occasionally slips off the groove that's meant to hold it when the case is in a viewing stand mode- I am afraid that the thin layer of metallic paint may peel off after using the case for a whileThe primary user of this case, our 10 year old daughter was very happy when told that she will be able to test drive Tribeca's case because she didn't have a cover that converted into a viewing stand but, after a few days of using it she rates it as a 'three stars' product, meaning ""it's Okay"" but only barely. I agree with her. Tribeca need to rethink the design and raise their quality standards if this is to become a better product.

Believe it or not, the makers of the EasyAcc actually listened to my observations and, I'm sure, comments from others and came up with an improved version that addresses two of the four 'negatives' I listed in my review.&#10004; FIXED - The four charging ports are only labeled as 4, 3, 2, 1... - The ports are now clearly labelled 5V/0.5A, 5V/1.3A, 5V/1.0A and 5V/1.2A.&#10004; FIXED - There is not storage solution for the many modular connectors... - A storage bag for connectors and wires is now included.Yes, the unit is still bulky and heavy and the black shiny finish is still a 'fingerprint magnet' but 'bulk' and 'weight' is the price you pay for 'power'. You should only consider this if you need lots of power and/or have multiple devices you'd want to charge simultaneously. Otherwise get something lighter and smaller,  EasyAcc's own3000mAh External Battery Pack Power Bankbeing only one of several good quality small chargers available at Amazon.I hesitated between 4 and 5 stars but given EasyAcc makers' openness to suggestions and actually implementing them when they make sense, my 4.5 stars rating is rounded up to 5._____________________________________________First things first: I didn't have to pay for the unit I'm reviewing because the distributor sent me a free one for review.The EasyAcc will charge itself through a Mini USB port from just about any standard 5V charger. The manual suggest not to attempt to charge it through a computer's USB because that may take forever. Even when using a dedicated charger providing 1500mA at 5V it may take a few hours to fully charge the EasyAcc. One side button will activate an array of 4 little blue lights, all lights on indicating a fully charged unit.I found this EasyAcc model to hold enough juice (12000 mAh according to specs) to charge several devices a couple of times over. The modular connectors provided include Mini and Micro USB, Nokia and iPhone/Pad/Pod (but not compatible with the newest iPhone).Output is through 4 Type A USB ports, each providing different levels of power, suited for different devices:- USB Port 1: 5V / 2.1A (iPad)- USB Port 2: 5V / 1.0A (iPhone)- USB Port 3: 5V / 1.3A (Samsung)- USB Port 4: 5V / 0.5A (Other Nokia)See the complete specs and the long list of compatible devices in the Tech Details and Product Description sections above.This unit has a couple of good things going for it:- large capacity- ability to charge several devices at the same time- many connectors including the standard USB Mini and Micro- vendor's technical specs section is very well done (which is why I thought I would not repeat that info in my review)But not everything is perfect and one must keep in mind the following before making a purchase decision:- The four charging ports are only labeled as 4, 3, 2, 1 (from left to right) so make sure you don't lose the manual or you won't know which port outputs 0.5A (4) and which does 2.1A (1).- It's bulky and heavy. Yes, it stores a big charge and yes, it's portable but it does weigh 0.7 pounds.- There is not storage solution for the many modular connectors and I counted 8 of them, most of them very small. A little bag or a case would have helped.- It's very good at collecting fingerprints that are not easy to remove.This EasyAcc is a good power bank solution. Yes, it's portable but barely given its size and weight. Since the power outputs can't be configured for the 4 ports, you can only take advantage of its ability to charge several devices simultaneously if they happen to match the 4 ports specs. On the other hand, I was able to charge my Nexus 7 twice and had enough juice left to fully charge a Kindle Paperwhite and a Blackberry Torch.My 3 stars rating is by no means a negative. Amazon suggests that 3 stars stand for ""It's Okay"" and that's how I view this unit. It holds and can output a large amount of energy which can be useful while on the road but I'd personally prefer something smaller and lighter. The 4 USB output ports are good to have but, even if not configurable in order to keep the cost low they should have been labelled properly.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[158, 182]","Large charge, size, weight - updated",2012,10, 25,0.8681318681318682,4242,740,Positive,158,182,24,0.026770884220810944,20121025

The 8GB model will probably be discontinued and you will get a 16GB Nexus 7 for the amount you pay for an 8GB model now. You will be able to get a 32GB Nexus 7 for the price of the current 16GB model.NOTE:My initial review was a Nexus 7 vs. the first generation Kindle Fire and the Nexus was a clear winner. I have now updated my review for the Fire HD. It's a close call but the Nexus' 4-core CPU and its pure Android, more open makeup make it my preferred 7-incher. However, the rest of my family prefers the Fire HD because it's such a great dedicated (Amazon) media consumption pad._______________________________________________We've been using a Kindle Fire since September 2011 (pre-ordered)  and I am happy we ordered ours. Soon after purchase it was adopted by our daughter. She is using it to draw and paint, she watches Netflix for Kids on it, she learned how to search Youtube for arts and crafts 'how to' videos and she plays (mostly free) games from Amazon's Appstore. The Fire wasn't a full-feature tablet when it launched but we overlooked its hardware shortcomings, its off-mainstream Android and its locking us out Google's much larger app store because the price was right and because the 7"" screen size made it lighter and more portable than the 'full size' 10.1"" alternatives. We are still happy with our Fire but we are happier with Nexus 7, our second 7"" tablet.Because Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle are both Android tablets very similar in screen size that sell for the same price, I am going to compare the two while I write about my experience with Nexus 7. Whenever appropriate, I will note the differences between Nexus and the Fire when such differences exist. If a feature is present on both tablets I will simply note its existence. I will prefix specific features with an equal sign if both tablets support it equally, a plus sign if the Nexus implementation is superior or Fire lacks it and a minus sign when a feature is better implemented by Fire or is a Fire exclusive.HARDWARE (Nexus 7 but it's a close call)The Nexus comes pretty close to what we normally call the latest and greatest (written in July 2012).+ GPS (Fire lacks it)+ Quad-core CPU vs. Fire's dual-core- 16/32GB models for Kindle vs. 16/32GB for Nexus- Dual-antenna for Wi-Fi on Kindle vs. one antenna on Nexus= Accelerometer= Backlit screen at 1280x800 are identical in specs and looks= Front-facing camera on both= Gyroscope= Micro USB port= Microphone on bothNeither the Fire or the Nexus come with memory expansion ports or a rear-facing camera. The Micro USB interface will allow you to attach flash drives and even powered USB HDDs but the fact remains that if you buy an Nexus 7 or a Kindle Fire HD you are stuck with built in amount of internal storage. At the same time, I will testify that I haven't used 8GB yet on my much older 16GB XOOM. A rear-facing camera would have been a plus.CONNECTIVITY (Nexus 7)The better connected a tablet is, the more useful it becomes. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD lack 3G/4G capabilities (Amazon will have a very expensive 4G model later this year), relying mostly on Wi-Fi to stay in touch with the world but there are some differences between the two worth noting.= WiFi 802.11 b/g/n= Amazon's Appstore= Bluetooth+ Near Field Communication (Fire lacks it) It allows two devices that support it to exchange information by touching each other. Not widely used at this time.+ Google Play (Fire restricts access to Amazon's Appstore only)I listed the app stores under connectivity mostly because Amazon made it impossible (unless you hack your Fire) to shop from anywhere other than Amazon's own store and I believe you are confined to Amazon's cloud services. There are no such restrictions on the Nexus. You can use Amazon's cloud, Google's or anyone else's if you so desire.SOFTWARE (Nexus 7)+ Android. Nexus 7 comes with Android 4.1 pre-installed, the latest version at the time I write this. It is very likely that it will be upgradeable to future versions. At the same time, it is not likely that the Fire's custom Android 3.x will ever be upgraded. It's possible but not likely.+ Chrome. It happens to be my favorite browser. Amazon does not allow Chrome on its Fire. Fire's own browser is not too bad but I personally prefer Chrome.= Flash. Nexus 7 or Android 4.1 rather does not support Flash which is too bad but it's because Adobe decided not to support it on Android 4.1. Kindle Fire HD does not appear to support Flash either.BUILD (a tie)I like both tablets look and feel. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD are strikingly beautiful tablets. One little issue for the Fire is its too well hidden power and volume controls but it's something that's likely to be annoying for the first few days only, until reaching for them becomes second nature.PRICE (Fire HD but it's a close call)The Fire HD appears is the less expensive one on the 16GB configuration but the difference is not as big as it may seem. Keep in mind that the Fire comes without a charger so you will have to buy one separately and you will have to pay Amazon some more if you don't want to see ads on it.MY CONCLUSIONSI've been using a Nexus 7 for over a month at the time I'm writing this. I've also been using a Kindle Fire HD for about a week now. I am fully aware that when it comes to 'tablets' the technology changes fast and I have little doubt that it will be surpassed by many newer models but, at the time I'm writing this, I have a personal preference for the Nexus 7 even though I enjoy using the Fire HD and they are nearly on par when it comes to 'media consumption' activities with the Fire HD clearly in the lead when the content's is Amazon.Neither the Nexus or the Fire are perfect. Both tablets, for example, lack memory expansion capabilities and a back camera. However, the Nexus, while selling for the about the same price, beats the Fire in every single category but it's a close call. If you are an Amazon person (like I am) the Nexus gives you the best of both worlds. You can still get your Amazon Appstore and the Kindle reader app but nothing restricts you from using someone else's store. The Fire HD erased the Nexus advantage on Bluetooth, camera and microphone. Amazon's new tables now match the Nexus 7 for many features and they even beat the Nexus on some (Wi-Fi, internal storage). In my case, I will continue to use the Nexus 7 but the rest of the family prefers the Kindle Fire HD.>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;___________________________________________NOTE ON STORAGE (memory)We are doing just fine with our 8GB Kindle Fire and our Nexus 7 is a 8GB model. I went for the 8GB model for 2 reasons: my year-plus experience with a 8GB Kindle Fire and a 16GB XOOM and, I must admit, a 16GB model wasn't available at the store  when I bought my Nexus.I agree that 16GB is always better than 8GB and a tablet with a SD card slot is better than one without. Objectively, 8GB may be okay for most of us but not all of us. Our 8GB Fire is less than half-full today and I never needed an SD card for our 16GB XOOM because, after more than a year, I have 4.8GB worth of Apps, 1GB worth of pictures and videos (all pics and videos I took with the XOOM) and 0.2GB worth of Audio.Had I decided to download my music library and the family photo albums on a tablet, 16GB might have been barely adequate and I would have used the SD memory expansion but I never felt that need. With videos coming from Youtube or movie streaming services and most of my music streaming from Pandora or cloud storage or our dedicated Media Server, 8GB appear to be okay (barely) and 16GB are quite plenty. Of course this may not be the case 2 years from now.I would buy the 16GB model if I was planning on storing lots of content other than apps on my tablet or simply wanted 'peace of mind' as in not worry about managing my tablet's storage. If not planning to keep lots of photos or videos or music on the Nexus then the 8GB may be just fine.","[413, 433]",Nexus 7 vs. Kindle Fire HD (updated),2012,07, 29,0.953810623556582,8119,1456,Positive,413,433,20,0.03520599250936329,20120729

Which begs the question: didn't we pay a premium for a tablet that calls itself 'HD' so that we could have sharper, brighter pictures? And the correct answer is 'yes'. The Fire HD has a beautiful display that just isn't meant to be enjoyed outside, on a sunny day. And given that this is not a removable screen protector and therefore the blurring is 'permanent', most of us a likely to be better off without it, possibly with a more traditional screen protector that does not diminish the display's quality.These being said, the GreatShield product is one of the better ones I'm aware of.

The G710+ is a fantastic 'touch' keyboard with excellent gaming enhancements.KEYBOARDS ARE FOR TYPINGThe G710+'s 'mechanical' technology provides both tactile and sound feedback on every key press which makes it the near perfect keyboard for a touch typist. If anyone still remembers the old IBM PC keyboards, the G710+ is a close relative when it comes to responsiveness, the key travel is just right and, even though it's marketed as a 'quiet' one, and it's certainly quieter than its super-noisy IBM ancestor, the clicking is loud enough to keep everyone in the room that someone is typing something.The build can be called 'solid' for good reason. This no featherweight pad. It's heavy and thick and thus steady and stable on a desk whether the little legs used to lift the back are extended or not. The keys layout is by and large standard. Shift, Tab, Caps Lock, Ctrl, Esc, Alt... they are all exactly where I expect them to be which is important to a touch typist. Special non-gaming keys include the usual 'media' controls: play, pause, skip, sound off and a volume roller. There is also a detachable palm rest.The G710+ needs 2 (two) USB 2.0 to connect but there is one port on the back that you can use to plug in a mouse or some other peripheral, therefore only one USB port is actually 'consumed'.KEYBOARDS ARE FOR GAMINGThere are 6 G keys which may not seem like a lot but if you multiply it by 3 - they are controlled by 3 M(ode) keys then you have 18 keys per profile and each can hold its own macro of anything from running an app, playing some key combination, even mouse movements. And you can have any number of profiles either game-specific profiles downloaded from Logitech's site - there were 250 last time I looked - or they can be custom-created or, of course, you can take a downloaded profile and modify it.And, since I mentioned profiles, the keyboard works with Logitech's Gaming Software. The app will scan your computer for any installed games and offer to download profiles for anyone it recognizes, help with profile management, macro developing or recording and assigning the macros to the G-keys. It's relatively easy to use and efficient and if you are not too familiar with macros, it comes with a number of good tutorials that explain everything.But... wait... there's more. There is a gaming key/switch that disables the 'start' and the 'menu' keys to prevent any unexpected outcome caused by hitting them accidentally instead of the Alt or Ctrl keys during gaming. Two additional keys control keys illumination. The lighting is only one color, white (except for the M keys which get yellow) but there are 5 levels of intensity. One button controls A S D W and the 4 dedicated arrow keys, the other is for everything else. This allows to have the 'direction' controls stand out if so desired.MY RATINGThis is not just an excellent gaming keyboard, it just happens to be one of the best general-purpose or typing keyboards I've used in a long, long, long time and I bet that almost anyone who doesn't mind keyboards that 'click' will agree. Everything is right about the G710+ except maybe the price.

For background, we have probably 3 dozen 'things' on our home Wi-Fi network at this time: a desktop, media servers, a few laptops, more tablets than I can count, smart phones, game consoles (both large and portable), Internet radios, receivers... you name it, all eager to serve our many work and entertainment needs (large family) but I can see how I won't be this Chromebook's only user for more than one reason.- Larger screen than a tablet's makes for a better video watching experience.- Attached keyboard makes in the preferred choice when emailing or text-chatting.- Quick boot time (5 seconds?) makes it always available when needed, unlike laptops, desktops.- Connectivity and 'ports' allow for easy expansion. My favorite is pairing with some decent Bluetooth speakers when watching a movie.THE MAJOR MINUSESOf course, not everything is perfect. Nothing ever is.There are some reasons to be concerned, mainly having to do with the availability of your data and its safety. It really comes down to 'do you trust Google with your data?' and to 'do you trust Google to always be there to provide you access to your data?'. My take on this is: do NOT store anything on anyone's cloud that you wouldn't share with a stranger and you wouldn't care much if you lost it. I always keep my personal and confidential data backed up more than once and on devices that can't be easily accessed by 'everyone'. My experience with Gmail is that Google's cloud is quite reliable for keeping casual information and I have no intention of storing anything other than casual content on Google's cloud in the future unless I find some perfect encryption scheme.The other issue is the availability of 'apps'. Google is in full control of what you can run on your Chromebook. If Google decides that you may not run Netflix tomorrow, Netflix is gone. And it's unlikely that you'll ever see Microsoft Office at Google's store. So, it all comes down to how happy you are with what Google offers you today and how confident you are that you are going to be happy with Google one year from now. But, to me, at this price, this is not big deal.I LOVE ITWhich explains my 5 star rating. I know, love needs not be explained or justified but, since I have a pretty good idea why I love this Chromebook, here it is. The price makes up for most of it, then it's the near-instant availability, the near-worry free availability of the apps expect to use most with it: entertainment, emails, text and video chats and the reasonably well engineered body that's light, comes with a decent display, good keyboard, most essential expansion ports.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[1, 1]",The best second computer (a little) money can buy,2012,11, 30,1.0,4728,824,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20121130

We are still using it. The Fire HD version is as good and has quite a few things going for it that most of the less expensive models lack:- it's easy to apply - it's literally a 2-minute job once the Kindle's screen is clean- you get zero bubbles - seriously, no bubbles whatsoever, not even a trace- it's easy to remove and then reapply- very sensitive to the touch - the HD appears to be as responsive with the iVisor on as it was before we applied- extremely durable - basing this on our classic Kindle experience where the iVisor we applied a few months ago is as good now as it was thenYes there is the 'rainbow' pattern. There is a note on the packaging claiming that it's visible when 'the Fire HD is off or viewed at a slanted angle'. I am happy to confirm that this is indeed the case. I can see the pattern when the Kindle is off but it completely disappears as soon as the screen lights up. So... yes, there is a rainbow visible and no, you can't see it if your Kindle is on unless, of course, it displays a 'black screen' which is rarely the case.Yes, the iVisor is expensive but, given that it appears to be almost-indestructible if used as directed, it may be the last screen protector you'll ever use with your Fire HD because if you can't stand the iVisor it's unlikely that you'll find anything better.","[2, 2]",Probably the last screen protector you'll ever use,2013,02, 26,1.0,1477,279,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20130226

This would have been a five star implement were it not for some output quality issues I will discuss below.INSTALLATION AND SETUPThe unit comes with a pretty good manual that eliminates all guessing. It clearly illustrates how to insert the battery and the tape cartridge and what the various buttons do.Once it's physically put together, the next step is the soft setup. When attached to a Windows or Mac through the supplied USB cable, the DYMO appears as an external drive and you can run the software located on its own storage. This is all it takes to use the label maker while attached to your computer.To prepare it for wireless use, you simply click on the Wi-Fi icon and it will find your networks and you can tell it which one to use, enter the password and it does the rest in about a minute or so. You will also be prompted to download and install the computer side of the software which will create a 'printer' under 'Devices and Printers' if you use Windows 7, install a Wi-Fi aware version of the label making software and some other utilitiesOPERATIONThe two physical controls you are going to use are the power button and the label cutter button and they are both large and easy to access, right on top of the unit. Pressing the power will also make the DYMO search for the Wi-Fi network and join it at which time a blue 'Wi-Fi' light lights up next to the power button.Charging is done either through the provided wall charger through the USB cable or through your computer's USB port but make sure it's a powered one.The software is relatively easy to use. It comes if a truckload of typefaces and lets you select sizes as well as bold, italic and underlined styles. For extra convenience, there is an 'address book' tab where found my Outlook list of contacts and was given the ability to browse for other address books to include. There is also an 'Insert' tab from where you can add things such as shapes, bar codes (several types), today's date, images and so on to your labels. I will upload an image of the main screen.Whenever ready to print, you simply press the 'print' button and your label comes out. Then you press the 'cut' button and you can retrieve your label and do with it as you please.RATINGDYMO's device is easy to use as far as label makers go.My only issues are with the output quality. The very small font sizes do not print very well. I know that you can always pick a larger type size but the software should not support sizes that the label maker can't print correctly. This is especially visible when you try to print multiple-lines address labels. Also, the output quality is not always acceptable. Print on the first label in a printing session is sometimes 'bad', probably because the portion of the tape that's been out the cartridge for a long time warps a little.These being said, I do like the DYMO and if I was looking for a small and easy/fun to use label maker DYMO's would be a prime candidate.","[0, 0]",Label me quick,2013,09, 15,,3190,572,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20130915

There is a wide range of Bluetooth-based wireless speakers to choose from but one may at least consider the iLuv if looking for something that is small, inexpensive and yet outputs decent sound.Surely, if 'price' is not an issue, you can get something truly wonderful such as theJabra SOLEMATE Bluetooth Portable Speaker - Retail Packaging - Black, also a little larger and significantly heavier and it will probably cost 4-5 times as much as the iLuv. Or, for only double the iLuv's price you may want to look at theiHome Portable, Rechargeable Bluetooth Stereo Speaker Systemwhich is larger, prettier, significantly louder, has much better stereo separation and a bass so powerful it makes the iHome dance when on a smooth surface.SIZE: The iLuv has 'small size' going for it. I would hesitate to say that it's easily portable because it doesn't come with a case, bag, or anything that would make it easy to carry it around. But it's small and it is portable if not 'easily' so.CHARGING: It charges through a Mini-USB port and there is a little USB cable in the package that can be plugged into a computer USB port and it should work with most generic or branded chargers.PAIRING: The manual shows how to pair with an iPad but it took about 5 seconds to do the same with an Android device.CONTROLS: There's the On/Off power button plus Volume Up/Down buttons and a 'Skip' button in-between that's also used for pairing. It work for pairing but I wasn't able to 'skip' anything on either Pandora or Winamp.PORTS: Besides the Mini USB charging port there is a AUX IN at the back if you wish to use the iLuv in a 'wired' configuration. I didn't' test it.LOOKS: The body is cheap or at least cheap-looking plastic (I'm reviewing the 'black' version) and I wouldn't call the design exactly inspired or innovative but anyone can see the iLuv's pics and decide for themselves.SOUND: This is a small speaker set so no one should expect anything approaching high fidelity. However, there is some stereo separation and the sound that comes out is decent, considering the size. You can set the volume to pretty loud.When rating the iLuv and would have size, price (big time), ease of setup and sound output to some degree as positives.

Soon after purchase it was adopted by our daughter. She is using it to draw and paint, she watches Netflix for Kids on it, she learned how to search Youtube for arts and crafts 'how to' videos and she plays (mostly free) games from Amazon's Appstore. The Fire wasn't a full-feature tablet when it launched but we overlooked its hardware shortcomings, its off-mainstream Android and its locking us out Google's much larger app store because the price was right and because the 7"" screen size made it lighter and more portable than the 'full size' 10.1"" alternatives. We are still happy with our old Fire and our newer Fire HD but we are happier with Nexus 7, our third 7"" tablet.Because Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle are both Android tablets very similar in screen size that sell for about the same price, I am going to compare the two while I write about my experience with Nexus 7. Whenever appropriate, I will note the differences between Nexus and the Fire when such differences exist. If a feature is present on both tablets I will simply note its existence. I will prefix specific features with an equal sign if both tablets support it equally, a plus sign if the Nexus implementation is superior or Fire lacks it and a minus sign when a feature is better implemented by Fire or is a Fire exclusive. I am sorry but I can't yet compare the Nexus 7 with the mini iPad because, while I did play with one for a few minutes, I didn't have a chance to test-drive one for any significant period of time.HARDWARE (Nexus 7 but it's a close call)The Nexus comes pretty close to what we normally call the latest and greatest.+ GPS (Fire lacks it)+ Quad-core CPU vs. Fire's dual-core= 16/32GB models for Kindle vs. 16/32GB for Nexus= Accelerometer= Backlit screen at 1280x800 are identical in specs and looks= Front-facing camera on both= Gyroscope= Micro USB port= Microphone on both- Dual-antenna for Wi-Fi on Kindle vs. one antenna on NexusNeither the Fire or the Nexus come with memory expansion ports or a rear-facing camera. The Micro USB interface will allow you to attach flash drives and even powered USB HDDs but the fact remains that if you buy an Nexus 7 or a Kindle Fire HD you are stuck with built in amount of internal storage. At the same time, I will testify that I haven't used 8GB yet on my much older 16GB XOOM so 16/32GB should be sufficient for most of us. A rear-facing camera would have been a plus.CONNECTIVITY (Nexus 7)The better connected a tablet is, the more useful it becomes. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD lack 3G/4G capabilities (Amazon will have a very expensive 4G model later this year), relying mostly on Wi-Fi to stay in touch with the world but there are some differences between the two worth noting.= WiFi 802.11 b/g/n= Amazon's Appstore (they both have it but, of course, the Fire's implementation is much better because that's basically where you are most of the time you are using the Fire= Bluetooth+ Near Field Communication (Fire lacks it) It allows two devices that support it to exchange information by touching each other. Not widely used at this time.+ Google Play (Fire restricts access to Amazon's Appstore only)I listed the app stores under connectivity mostly because Amazon made it impossible (unless you hack your Fire) to shop from anywhere other than Amazon's own store and I believe you are confined to Amazon's cloud services. There are no such restrictions on the Nexus. You can use Amazon's cloud, Google's or anyone else's if you so desire.SOFTWARE (Nexus 7)+ Android. Nexus 7 comes with Android 4.2 pre-installed, the latest version at the time I write this. There is no doubt that it will be upgradeable to future versions, at least for the next couple of years. At the same time, it is not likely that the Fire's custom Android will ever get a major Android upgrade even though Amazon may tweak it a little from time to time.+ Chrome, most other Google apps. Chrome happens to be my favorite browser. Amazon does not allow Chrome on its Fire. Fire's own browser is not too bad but I personally prefer Chrome.= Flash. Nexus 7 or Android 4.2 rather does not support Flash which is too bad but it's because Adobe decided not to support it on Android. Kindle Fire HD does not appear to support Flash either.BUILD (a tie)I like both tablets look and feel. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD are strikingly beautiful tablets. One little issue for the Fire is its too well hidden power and volume controls but it's something that's likely to be annoying for the first few days only, until reaching for them becomes second nature. Our daughter has been using the new Fire HD ever since launch and she's used to it by now.PRICE (advantage Nexus)The Nexus 7 is the less expensive one on the 16GB configuration especially when you consider that fact that the Fire comes without a charger so you will have to buy one separately and you will have to pay Amazon some more if you don't want to see ads.MY CONCLUSIONSI've been using both a Nexus 7 ever since launch and the same is true for the Fire HD. I am fully aware that when it comes to 'tablets' the technology changes fast and I have little doubt that it will be surpassed by many newer models but, at the time I'm writing this, I have a clear personal preference for the Nexus 7 even though I enjoy using the Fire HD and they are nearly on par when it comes to 'media consumption' activities with the Fire HD clearly in the lead when the content's is Amazon.Neither the Nexus or the Fire are perfect. Both tablets, for example, lack memory expansion capabilities and a back camera. However, the Nexus, while selling for the about the same price, beats the Fire in every single category but it's a close call. If you are an Amazon person (like I am) the Nexus gives you the best of both worlds. You can still get your Amazon Appstore and the Kindle reader app but nothing restricts you from using someone else's store. The Fire HD erased the Nexus advantage on Bluetooth, camera and microphone. Amazon's new tables now match the Nexus 7 for many features and they even beat the Nexus on some (Wi-Fi, internal storage). In my case, I will continue to use the Nexus 7 but the rest of the family prefers the Kindle Fire HD.>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[59, 70]",Nexus 7 vs. Kindle Fire HD 7 (updated),2012,11, 15,0.8428571428571429,6361,1138,Positive,59,70,11,0.02397003745318352,20121115

In fact, I am using Logitech's little keyboard to write this review on the T400. I could not pair the keyboard with a Blackberry Torch because, while it did recognize it, the Blackberry asked that I entered a secret code that the keyboard expected and 'zeroes' did not work. The only problem, and this IS a major annoyance, the keyboard only remembers the last pairing. Once I paired it with the PS3, it forgot about the iPhone. Pairing it with the XOOM made it forget about the PS3 so, if you want to use it with multiple devices you'll have to go through the about 30-second 'pairing' process every time you switch. Not good.The keyboard, while not 'full size' is large enough and responsive enough to allow for fast typing. I was pleasantly surprised to see that most 'special functions'  worked on the non-Apple devices - could control the speakers on/off and volume and the player on the T400 and the XOOM, the magnifying glass key brought up 'search' and so on.

And I like it a lot but not completely 'love' it because- it produces the most awesome sound I've ever heard coming from a speaker this small when you pop up what the makers call the 'expandable resonator'- it's really, really cute looking- plug and play, literally - requires no setup or configuration to play, you simply plug the the 3.5 mm jack into your device's audio output- charges off your computer or any standard USB charger- lasts for many hours (they say up to 8) on one charge- USB charging cable is included- comes with a nice bag where it can be stored and protected from scratches while not in useIn fewer words, it's the best 'inexpensive' external speaker I'm aware of. Yes, a wireless, Bluetooth capability would have been nice but I tried out a few wireless speakers that I didn't like at all, mainly because they sounded and looked 'cheap' and the Bluetooth implementation was a little iffy. I also wished the built-in (which is a great idea) audio cable was a couple of inches longer but I can see that it would have been more difficult, though not impossible, to hide it in a groove at the bottom of the base when not in use.If what you need is a small (smaller than a baseball when not expanded), inexpensive, cute looking, great sounding but not too loud, easy to operate wired, mono speaker, this is it. I would have loved the FiGO (five stars) if the audio wire was a little longer and the volume went a little louder.","[4, 4]",Good Vibrations,2013,05, 3,1.0,1941,346,Positive,4,4,0,0.022537046083699722,20130503

Some weren't convinced until they could touch it and place it against their ear.____________________________________________________________I am not keen to review little mono Bluetooth speakers because most of them turn out to be worth little. Or, given the increasingly high quality of tablets and even phones little speakers, not worth the trouble of operating them as their use often replaces a tablet's superior stereo sound with lower quality mono. There are, of course exceptions and, as expected, they tend to be at the high-end... end of the price scale.With the above in mind, Tonez' CAN speaker is one of the few that, in my view, is actually worth getting. It delivers extraordinarily crisp sound coupled with a surprisingly powerful bass. Yes, it's not true stereo but it's easy to overlook that once it starts playing. And it can play very, very loud for a contraption this small. No, it does not 'fill the room' but it comes close and the bass is almost booming in a most impressive way.Now, for the 'not so good' observations:- The MicroSD playback capability is a little bit of an overkill because all you can do is to sequentially skip from one song to the next and if you have more than a dozen songs on your card it's not that practical.- The claim that it can operate from 'up to 50 ft' from its host may be slightly exaggerated. Sound started to break once I moved 12-15 ft away while testing it in a largely empty basement. I suspect that a 50 ft range could be achieved under some very ideal conditions.- Due to the lack of a visual display other than the little blinking LED, controls are sometimes touch and go but that it's no big deal if all you do is 'Bluetooth'.- Controlling playback (stop/pause/resume) on the host is not always possible. It didn't work for me while testing with Pandora on an Android PC.With these in mind, the CAN still gets 4 stars because I like it to the point of almost loving it. It's a great output device for as long as you ignore the unnecessary features that are either not needed (radio, MicroSD support) or way too much trouble to implement when considering the rewards (chaining of several CANs together, using it as a MicroSD card reader, controlling it from 2 different devices, the radio feature). Consolidating the positive impression is the included and very nice carrying bag, the charger and charging cable, the clearly high-end design and build.If you feel like Bluetooth pairing your phone or tablet with a very small speaker that can be very loud and outputs brilliant, loud sound with great bass and it's not going to break your budget then go for it. All the other features... not so impressive so look elsewhere if you really want a little speaker that can be used as a MicroSD card reader (really?) or plays over the air radio or allows you to chain several of them (why?).Oh... specs:- Speaker: 40mm, 2.6&#937;, 3W- Frequency response: 60Hz-18kHz (sounds better then the specs)- Lithium battery capacity: 430 mAh- THD: &#8804; 0.5%- SNR: &#8805; 95dB- Size: 60mm x 54mm- Bluetooth: 3.0","[5, 5]",Overpromises but delivers where it counts,2013,12, 24,1.0,3271,554,Positive,5,5,0,0.02256961406936981,20131224

The makers of Simbans believe it is so and, to prove it, they provided me with a 'for review' unit so that I can see it for myself and write about it. I am not fully convinced.To start with the 'goods', yes, this Android 4.2 tablet does handle games and the various Google apps without crashing. I was able to play Temple Run, for example and I was able to survive for the first few hundred meters even though the frame rate was not the smoothest. Netflix... barely, It showed me the first 5 minutes or so of a movie, then went into 'buffering' mode and stayed there until the battery ran out. The camera does take pictures and it even supports Android's 360-degree camera mode but the resolution is low and the response to touch could be better.But I'm getting a little ahead of myself because I'm talking about the good features right now so, before I lose focus, let me make a case of why anyone would want to consider purchasing this product.- Inexpensive: I may be wrong but I don't believe that you can get a tablet (not a joke) that actually works for this little money.- Pure Android: unlike the Kindle Fire so, if you know and love your Android Simbans' tablet interface should feel familiar. With Android comes Google's store and everything in it can be downloaded and installed. The low price and its 'pure Android' makeup  contribute to most of the three stars because it's mostly downhill from here.- MicroSD storage expansion port. It's worth mentioning because most 'mainstream' 7"" tablets do not have it.- Screen protector: it ships with a screen protector attached so if you see air bubbles on the front, don't be afraid or concerned, it's not a defect and feel free to remove it if you don't want it.And here is what anyone should be aware of (not so good qualities and features) before buying it.- Low specs: the sellers are quite honest so simply see them all listed at products's page. 4GB of onboard storage, low screen resolution, slow CPU all contribute to a low performance tablet but... remember, it's sells for half the price of last year's gorgeous Kindle Fire HD.- Non-standard charger: I expect to be able to charge a tablet through a Micro USB port so that I don't go into panic mode when the supplied non-standard charger stops working or is lost or left behind. I tend not to buy any gadget that doesn't support standard USB chargers because I simply don't need the trouble.- Narrow viewing angle: whether up/down or left/right you better be staying right in front of your little tablet, adjust it for optimal viewing and then don't move much because the moment you move... you'll have to readjust the tablet. To estimate the optimal viewing angle at 30-degrees before colors begin morphing may be a little too generous.- No Bluetooth: this is quite a disappointment because the built-in tiny speakers aren't sufficient. Yes, it's probably possible to plug 'something' through the headphones port but Bluetooth is the convenient way and it's not supported.There are a few more reasons to think twice before going with this tablet and they include some rather unimpressive battery life of maybe a couple of hours on a full charge, no GPS, a Chinese-only manual (seller stated in an email that buyers should get an English manual and I was given the Chinese version by mistake).The vendor believes that this tablet should be given to children because it doesn't cost too much. My personal view tends to be the opposite. Children tend to be less patient and more demanding  of their toys and gadgets than adults and I am afraid that they are not going to tolerate well a tablet that comes with a below average display, slow response to touch controls and is slow overall. But that is only my opinion. I am currently trying to set it up as an interface for a Harmony remote control and an Onkyo receiver which both come with their Android control apps. Not done yet but I will come back to this review and report once I have something to share.The three stars ""It's Okay"" are granted from the point of view of someone who makes an informed decision - see all of the above. Nobody should expect a top-of-the-line gadget at that price so, yes, it's slow and weak but it's also cheap.____________________________________________________NOTES:- My price-related comments were made when the tablet was on sale for $69. Obviously, prices can and do change and if the main reason for a positive review is 'price' then that goes away or diminishes when the prices goes up.- This is almost entirely my fault but I managed to fry the tablet. I was complaining about the non-standard charger above - I always prefer USB because they are so common and easy to share. Well... by mistake, I plugged my Samsung's Chromebook proprietary charger into the tablet's charging port and it happened to fit. It also destroyed the tablet.

I do NOT like Sony's insistence of requiring a non-standard USB cable for charging and data transfer. While you can get around it when it comes to your memory card's file management, you must have a less common UC-E6 USB cable for charging the battery. And based on on my prior experience with a Sony Alpha, their tech support either don't know or won't tell you that you can buy a generic cable but will happily grossly overcharge you for a 'branded' replacement.I also wish the camera came with a case or a little bag, anything to protect it from scratches. Yes, we can supply our own and Sony will be happy to nickel-and-dime you a little and sell you theSony LCSCSQ Soft Carrying Case for Sony T, W, and N Series Digital Cameras (Black)but I would have preferred to have it as part of the package.Not a negative at all, but it's worth noting that you need to supply your own memory card because the camera 'as is' can only take about 3 pictures. It's not a negative because you should be the one to decide what you want and in what size. After popping in a not so expensiveTranscend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Cardthe camera tells me that it can take 4710 shots at the highest resolution. Not bad.To conclude, I like Sony's camera a lot and I may end up buying another one for my wife who wants something very small that is 'not a phone'.

It's more or less what we expected and, to get the bad out of the way, let me start with what I really really didn't like about it, then I will discuss the good features.________________________________________________THE BAD STUFF- Windows 8 - Yes, I know Toshiba doesn't make Windows and '8' is Microsoft's current 'latest and greatest' but that doesn't change the fact that it's basically Windows 7 with a largely unintuitive and often awkward user interface. Toshiba doesn't make 'Windows' but they could have picked Windows 7 and many customers would be happier. Windows 8 may work well with a touch screen but Toshiba's laptop's screen is not responsive to touch so... there.- Crapware galore - I do not appreciate that every time we get a new laptop we must spend hours cleaning up the useless 'try us for free for 30 or 60 days and then, if you don't know how to get rid of us, we will remind you daily for the rest of your life that you have the option to buy our app, if only to make these annoying reminders disappear'. It's annoying and some of this stuff, and I'm looking at you, Norton, will fight you, kick and scream while you are trying to get rid of it.- Post warranty support - our experience with another Toshiba laptop was that, once you're out of warranty, Toshiba will throw you out to the wolves. Unlike, let's say Sony, who would usually fix anything they sell if broken for a reasonable price, Toshiba will suggest that you contact some 'independent' shop that would see you as a money cow, to be milked until dry. I was fully aware of this - prior personal experience with an older Satellite - but the relatively low price and the fact that we aren't planning to keep this for longer than 2 years (will donate it then) had us buying from Toshiba again.- No Blu-ray - seriously? 7 years later Toshiba hasn't heard of this 'new' technology or doesn't think it's worth supporting it? We didn't care because we had several external Blu-ray drives but you should be aware of this before you buy.________________________________________________As bad as the above may be, we went with Toshiba in spite of the shortcomings because we were curious about Windows 8, knew we had the skills to remove the crapware and, as I said, don't plan to keep it for too long. And there are plenty of good reasons to go with this model.________________________________________________THE GOOD STUFF- Nicely built - We had an older satellite and we liked it. This is not the lightest laptop your money can buy but it looks good and it feels solid. Nothing about it appears 'cheap'.- Speedy - It's not a gaming laptop but if you're running 'Office' on it and hope to watch movies (remember, no Blu-ray) or stream anything, this Satellite does a good job.- 1TB HDD, USB 3.0 ports, i7 processor, 8GB RAM - all of the above make up for a nice system that can handle just about anything you can throw at it, other than some serious gaming.- Large keyboard - it's a relatively 'big' laptop so this is no surprise. However, this is a nice keyboard even a touch typist would love.- Large touch pad - it's multi-touch and helps ease some of the Windows 8 pain.- Okay display - thought to squeeze this under the 'good stuff'. It's nothing breathtaking but it's decent. You are going to use this either with a keyboard and mouse and monitor attached, in which case the display doesn't matter or as a stand-alone laptop and, for a laptop, this display will do.________________________________________________To conclude, this Satellite can be a good buy, especially when Amazon puts in on sale and if you are prepared to live with or deal with its shortcomings. One month or so later, my kid is happy with it and believe he will continue to be happy with it for at least the next 2 years.We 'like' it as is and we made informed to buy this model and I hope that my review may help any potential buyers to make their own informed decisions.","[0, 0]",Good for the next 2 years but be aware of shortcomings,2013,07, 16,,4070,725,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20130716

These don't.Here we have a pair of rather expensive headphones that just don't live up to their price. The sound quality may be good enough for games where 'average' sound quality can be tolerated. For other activities such as listening to music however, they're just inferior. On a positive note, the setup was was mindlessly simple and the headphones are portable and could be connected to a range of devices such as PCs, the Wii, the PS3 or the Xbox but the headphone's pros just can't outweigh the cons. I am not happy with this product. In fact, I don't like it at all. It's 2 stars out of 5 and here's why.SETUP: 4 of 5I've been using the Monster EA Sports Game Headset for about a couple of days now with our gaming PC. The setup was mindlessly easy - there is no software to install and the headphones were ready to use as soon as I plugged them into a USB port.Of course, there's a price to pay for simplicity. Without software and absent any physical controls, what you get is what you get. There is no equalizer, can't throttle the bass or have any control over anything. Yes, there is a 'game mode' button but it doesn't do much.Oh, and for something annoying, attaching the microphone boom gave me some extra problems. What the manual won't tell you is that you really have to jam the microphone into the headphone port before it will actually work. I jammed it and it works now.ERGONOMICS: 1 of 5I understand that most gaming equipment is wired to avoid emergency battery changes/charges but it's annoying and uncomfortable to have a heavy pile of wire always dragging my head to one side. The only good thing that this VERY long, thick wire is good for is the fact that it won't be very likely you'll need an extension to it for any system you use. But I'm using it with my PC now and I am about 3 feet away from my USB port and there is what seems to be a quarter mile worth of thick and heavy wire connecting me to it.Monster seems to claim that these headphones are comfortable even after hours of gameplay. No, I disagree!  While I can keep them on for an hour or two they are not comfortable. The ear cushions are small that are always pressing into my ear. I personally don't like anything constantly pushing on my ear. This minor irritation occurs immediately after I put it on, but fortunately doesn't get much worse after that.QUALITY: 1 of 5The headphones are very compact but there is a downside to their small size and the negative impact is where it counts the most: the sound quality which is rather basic.  Having used a much larger SoundBlaster headphones, the Monster's sound quality just seems flat and dead. There is no bass as far as I can tell, and can't play them too loudly without filling your ears with static from sound amplification -atrocious. Another part that bothers me is the volume control bar. There can't be any physical controls on the headphones themselves because they are small so where do you put it? About two feet down that long wire for easy reach. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that it weighs more than I require to be comfortable. I would usually solve this problem by putting it on my desk, but it's too close to the headphones for that! It pretty much has to remain in the air, at easy reach, hooray.Also on the volume controls is the option to turn the EA logo's LED on or off. That's a nice option. If you were to turn it on while talking to someone with your microphone, they would be treated to constant static. I don't know why it can only be heard while the LED is on, but I assure you, that terrible noise is unbearable to the person on the other end.CONCLUSION: 2 starsMonster is famous for making super-expensive but good quality, well designed products. These headphones are indeed super-expensive but their quality is poor and so is the design.

If 'cost' is an issue and 720p only is not a bother then the LT should be a great pick for half the price.True for all Roku models: there's an enormous amount of channels to choose from, including most popular ones. And if there's something that you can't find in the official store you can always check the private channel listings (I included the URL of my favorite site) which is where I found things such as streaming CNN, CNN International and BBC World.The streaming is exceptionally smooth. Quite impressive considering that I set this Roku on the second floor, some 60-70 ft. and two floors away from our Wi-Fi router located in the basement.This model especially, due to the more powerful processor is easy to operate through Roku's very basic remote control.Roku 3 and all Rokus are stable. I didn't have the Roku 3 for too long (will update) but my experience with a Roku LT was that it almost never crashes and I only had to manually reconnect to my Wi-Fi router once over a 6-months period.The 'universal search' feature is quite amazing. You simply type in the name of a movie or show even an actor and you will see all you options on all channels and you will know in advance whether it's going to be free or exactly how much it was going to cost. On the Roku 3 all information appears almost instantly._______________________________________________________________THE FAQI will try to keep this section as objective (factual) as possible.Q: Why would I want a Roku?A: Roku has, by far, the largest number of 'channels' vs. any other competing product. If you like exploring content beyond the popular services (Netflix, Amazon, etc.) you should consider a Roku?Q: Why would I want a Roku 3?A: When compared to previous models, this one has a much faster processor, 5 times faster. The faster processor allows you to quickly navigate the new and much improved user interface but if 'speed' is not an issue, the new interface will appear on the older models by April, 2013. This model also adds a 'private listening' capability through a provided pair of headphones that plug directly into the remote control. In addition it supports Dual-band wireless for faster streaming when connected to a router that supports the feature and has a USB port.Q: When I shouldn't pick a Roku 3 over other Roku models?A: Roku 3 does not support 'standard' (non HD) TVs but earlier models do. You should select a 'lesser' model such as the Roku LT when price is the issue and/or your HD TV is limited to 720p and 'speed' is not an issue.Q: What can I play through the USB port?A: Video: MP4 (H.264), MKV (H.264); Audio: AAC, MP3; Image: JPG, PNG.Q: Is the Roku 3 expandable?A: Yes. There a MicroSD slot for additional game and channel storage memory.Q: Can I use a Roku 3 with any TV lacking an HDMI port?A: No.Q: What are the best screen resolution and audio supported by Roku 3?A: 1080p, 7.1/5.1 surround sound.Q: Is the Roku 3 energy efficient?A: According to Roku, typical power consumption is 3.5W when streaming HD video.Q: How do I connect a Roku 3 to the Internet?A: You can do it wither via Wi-Fi or through the wired Ethernet port. Technically speaking: 802.11 dual-band (a/b/g/n compatible) with WEP, WPA, and WPA2 support (wireless) and 10/100 Base-T Ethernet for the wired connection.Q: What is not included but I must have to make my Roku 3 work besides a TV and an Internet router?A: An HDMI cable.Q: Can I control the Roku 3 with a universal remote?A: Yes.Q: Do I need line of site to control the Roku 3?A: No if you use Roku's own remote, yes if you use a universal remote control.Q: Can I play games on the Roku 3?A: Yes, it comes with Angry Birds Space preloaded and you may add more games from the store.Q: Are the Roku channels free?A: Many of them are but Roku also streams 'premium' channels for which you will require a separate subscription.Q: What are private channels.A: These are channels that, for whatever reason, are not listed by the channel store. You can easily make them 'appear' on your TV by picking them from one of the sites that lists such channels. See the first comment to this review for the URLs of such sites.Q: How much it costs to use a Roku?A: Once purchased, it could cost you nothing. Or you may subscribe to one or more premium services.Q: Can I have more than one Roku tied to one account?A: Yes.Q: Can I search for a specific movie or show across all of Roku's channel?A: Yes, you can. Even better, Roku will not only tell you which channel carries it but you will know in advance if it will cost you and how much it will cost to view or 'rent' it. You can also search for other related information such as movies featuring one specific actor.Q: Can I watch YouTube on the Roku?A: Yes, a YouTube channel was launched on December 17, 2013.Q: Can I get live news channels on the Roku?A: Yes. You may be able to find such channels at the store or as private channels listings but most US 'mainstream' news channels only offer a selection of recent on-demand videos. [I have a link to a listing of 'Roku channels that contain at least one live TV feed' on the comments section, the FIRST comment to this review. Be aware that the listing may not be complete, that some of the channels are 'premium' and that some of them may drop live streams.Q: Are non-video streams supported?A: Yes, radio stations and music streaming channels such as Pandora are supported._______________________________________________________________NOTE:The YouTube channel became available for the US, Canada and Ireland in December 2013.","[4080, 4267]","Enormous channels selection, including YouTube  (hands-on plus FAQ)",2013,03, 6,0.9561752988047809,5714,1001,Positive,4080,4267,187,0.14919394235466538,20130306

The TX-NR525 has the ability to control everything physically connected to it and it seamlessly reaches out to other devices on our home network and beyond, to the Internet. The temptation to go over every single feature I am aware of is strong but receivers have become complex, multi-featured machines and there's a comprehensive manual that does that. I will therefore talk about what the HR-RC460 did as I tested it and what I found impressive or not so much, useful or less so, feature-rich or overwhelmingly complex or complicated. This could mean that I may not speculate about features that some may find worth discussing at some length and accept it as inevitable but I wasn't able to test hands-on. My hope is that the setup I used for my test drive is not unlike what most typical users are likely to have.The TX-NR525 was tested as a 5.1 surround system. I did not set a second zone. Directly attached to it via HDMI were a TV, a satellite box, a WD media hub, a Blu-ray/DVD player and a gaming console with the last three having their own Ethernet connections. A security camera system was attached through a component video cable. The receiver was connected to the Internet via a Ethernet cable which in turn talks to a router over the power lines. The receiver and everything hard-wired to it were set to be operated with a Harmony universal remote control.FIRST IMPRESSIONSRight out of the box, Onkyo's receiver is not unlike the one (by Sony) I've been using for the past 4 years ant it's very much like the HT-RC460 which is the receiver I'm using because I happen to have a set of 7.2 speakers:- 5.2 surround: one extra woofer and speakers of anything between 6-16 Ohms- 2 zones- supports nearly all types of I/O: composite video and analog audio, coax, optical, HDMI (more ports with 8 in, 2 out, the higher v1.4), AM and FM antennae.- numerous sound processing modes with some new ones such as Dolby Pro Logic IIz and DTS Neo:6 decoding- video resolution beyond 1080p to cover 3D and 4K (the resolution used in movie theaters)And if the above appear to be only minor enhancements or features (4K video?) that no one is likely to need 'today', here are some brand new capabilities that should easily justify upgrading from an older model.- Ethernet- DLNA- Overlaid on-screen menusWhether the above are significant upgrades it depends on each individual's needs. I will discuss them below and explain why they matter to me. What follows is my experience with the product during my week-long test drive.PACKAGING AND CONTENTSBesides the receiver's body I found a CD that holds the manual as a .pdf file, the remote control and its 2 AA batteries, the AM/FM antennae and the special-purpose mic with a very long wire used to calibrate the speakers. This receiver does not come bundled with speakers or speaker wires or any other accessories.The contents are well protected inside the box and I know that they are so because UPS subjected the package to some extremely rough treatment and yet everything inside turned out to be Okay.INSTALLATIONNo, it wasn't easy and it took q while to get things going but Onkyo providing a set of sticky, color-coded labels for the speaker wires helped a lot my connecting a set of 5.1 existing speakers to the new receiver.Some of the HDMI inputs are pre-labeled as Cable/Satellite, Game, DVD, Computer and that made setting the HDMI connections easier and easier to document.Once the wiring is done the receiver can automatically calibrate the speakers using the supplied, special-purpose calibration mic. A full auto-calibration round completes in less than 10 minutes.If the box was connected to the network it's likely through the Ethernet wire it will suggest a firmware update. After than... there are many paths.You may complete the setup using the provided remote control and the receiver's own display or you may take advantage of the on-screen menus feature which is a lot more efficient. The on-screen menus make it easy to integrate the receiver into an universal remote control. I am currently using it with a Harmony 900. Alternatively, I can use an Android tablet with the Onkyo remote app installed and I do use it, especially when I play content off the Internet or other devices on my home network but more about that later.My setup didn't take advantage of some of the more advanced features that HDMI 1.4 implements such us the Ethernet channel that would allow the receiver to share its Internet link with other connected devices such as network-capable TVs, Blu-ray or media hubs or the audio return channel that can send the audio signal from a playback device such as the TV back to the receiver.OPERATIONThe word of the day is 'flexibility', or you can be as sophisticated as you care or dare or you can let the receiver do what it thinks it's best for you and probably get 95% of what you would if you spent hours tweaking and trying out settings individually. The manual enumerates everything, feature by feature and there are many features, some very useful, quite a few such us image adjustments, redundant. The other word of the day is comprehensiveness.When it comes to audio, Onkyo's receiver supports just about any standard in existence and it will do its best to provide you with the optimal output. You can set it all to 'auto' or you can tell it what to do whether you are listening to music, playing a game or watching a movie. You can tweak with individual speakers. Same for video. You can play with individual settings all you want and if the end-result doesn't look nearly as good as the defaults you can quickly revert back to the default settings and then try it again.I'm using a Harmony and I didn't use it myself extensively but the remote control has the capability to control everything at the entertainment hub. The manual explains how to do it and has hundreds of codes for the various brands and models.FEATURESLike for most receivers, dealing with HD TVs, cable or satellite boxes, Blu-ray players and gaming devices is 'base business', especially when they are connected through HDMI. Onkyo's receiver does it well and so do most other receivers. But this is not all that Onkyo does.But then you connect to your home network and a world of new possibilities opens up.While AM and FM radio are still supported, Onkyo's receiver can and will get your local Internet-broadcasting stations. The vTuner service will get you that but you can also play any station in the world and you can search by location (continent/country/city), genre (available inside each country as well), popularity and so forth. I had no idea until a couple of days ago that my favorite Electronica radio was broadcasting from Romania.But that's not all. Besides radio stations, the TX-NR525 supports a number of services, including my favorite, Pandora which comes loud and clear and so far commercials-free. Other services include SiriusXm, Slacker, AUPEO!, last.fm, Spotify, MP3tunes, Rhapsody and I suspect that additional ones may be added through future firmware upgrades.And there are more features. You can play iPhone content via the dedicated port easily accessible on the front.I suspect that there are many other features I didn't notice or I didn't find to be interesting enough to mention here but someone else would view as very important but I'm going to stop because there's the big .pdf manual that discusses almost everything.PROS AND CONSThe big pros for this receiver are, in my view:- Seamless network/Internet integration that unlock so many interesting features and capabilities- On-screen (and it can be TV or phone or tablet screen) menus which overlay over the existing video display.- Extreme flexibility in configuration from the 'let Onkyo figure it out for me' level to very detailed tweaking.As for cons. Well... the manual is not the most user-friendly in the world but I can live with that. The Android remote control app while great and very easy to use needs an urgent update because the 'phone' resolution does not scale well on a 10-inch tablet and it seems to prevent the Android device from going to sleep even when the app is not in the foreground. Also, the warranty is a little too restrictive and appears to discourage on-line purchases - see below.MY RATINGWarranty-related issues aside, I am very pleased with this receiver. It does everything I expect from a receiver and then it does more and better. In other words, it exceeded my expectations which qualifies it for a 5 stars with flying colors rating._________________________________________________WARRANTY AND SUPPORTI did not weigh in warranty and service when I rated the receiver as a 5 star. Depending on where you buy your receiver from a brick and mortar dealer or online, you may be very happy with Onkyo's warranty or less so.The receiver's warranty is for 2 years, parts and labor which is a good thing. There are lots of exclusions, nothing unusual, ranging from you altering the product, it being damaged by things connected to it or you using it for commercial purposes. If you bought this online or you are planning to do so, consider the following:- Save your receipt AND the original box because you are going to need them both if you are to ship the receiver for warranty repairs.- Onkyo's warranty only covers units purchased from an authorized dealer. Onkyo considers Amazon to be authorized dealer but... don't forget: receipt, box.- My understanding is that you will be paying for shipping the receiver to Onkyo but they will be covering shipping when returning the box back to you.- There are no quick replacement/cross-shipping provisions so be prepared to do without if your receiver breaks down and needs repair.- If, after reading the above you are concerned about warranty service you should consider purchasing your receiver from a 'brick and mortar' authorized dealer because then all you need to do is take the box back to the dealer and you won't have to worry about paying for shipping and keeping the original box.Onkyo made a great receiver but they should consider improving their support for online purchases because other sellers of electronic devices do much better. When a monitor and a rather large laptop I purchased online broke both makers sent me a box and a pre-paid shipping label. I understand why the makers of complex devices would rather have us buy from dealers, because they don't need to worry about direct user support, but online purchases are a reality and other makers of electronics provide much better/friendlier support to their online customers.---------->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[43, 47]",Five Stars for a well-rounded and feature-rich 5.2 surround receiver,2013,05, 24,0.9148936170212766,10893,1841,Positive,43,47,4,0.023676925582152744,20130524

Unless it's a gaming mouse or comes with some incredibly innovative features. Microsoft's 'sculpt comfort' does come with some innovation - a clickable, touch-sensitive blue button on the left side and the strange ability to make the mouse vibrate - but it's very much a nice, affordable mouse.Here are some of its 'good' features:- Bluetooth connected: the best feature in my view because it eliminates the need not only for a cord but also for the USB dongle that many wireless mice come with.- Versatile: I was able to quickly pair it with a Windows 7 computer, a Windows 8 computer and even with a ChromeBook and pairing it and it becoming ready to use took just seconds.- Good value: it's quite inexpensive for an overall good quality 2-button/scroll wheel mouse.- Optimized for right-hand use.

It's as simple as sliding the Off/On switch to the On position and then pressing the dedicated 'Pair' key. Charging is done through a Micro-USB port and the USB cable (but not the actual charger) is included. Any 5V/1A AC wall charger or should do the job and, I suspect, you can even do it off your laptop.When used with other devices, the back cover on which the Tab would attach folds back while the keyboard is in use and forms a protective keyboard case when the keyboard is not in use.The physical keyboard is laid out quite nicely and as a touch typist I feel quite comfortable using it. Most keys are where you would expect, the major exception being the ' (single and double quotes) key, moved to the left of the space bar to make roon for a full size 'Enter' key. The other minor annoyance would be the 'Backspace' key which should be double-size but is 'normal' size. There are no function keys but there is a row of special keys above the numbers row. The keys feel good to the touch, not unlike a good quality laptop keyboard only a little smaller.GALAXY TAB INTEGRATIONThe back cover allows for a 10"" Galaxy Tab 3 to snap in and there is a back support leg that would keep the Tab raised while the keyboard lies flat on your desk. It's very nice actually and the feeling is not unlike that of an enhanced Chromebook with added touch screen capabilities.The cover is cut to expose the camera and everything else that needs to be exposed. When it's closed the back support leg becomes part of the back cover and there is a magnetic flap to keep it that way so you end up with a very slim, elegant and reasonably light package. The cover protects both the keyboard and the tablet.RATINGThis is highly recommended either as probably the best Galaxy Tab keyboard or as a very, very nice 'universal' Bluetooth keyboard.

The 'Technical Details' section of the product page very accurately describes the format supported and some of the basic features. There are 4 physically different card slots, one of each side of the square-shaped reader.FEATURES AND ERGONOMICSThe non-removable (hard-wired) 3-inch USB cable makes the reader different from most of similar products out there. It's used to connect the reader either directly to your computer or to a USB hub, be it USB 2.0 or USB 3.0. This is a good idea because it makes it possible for the small, square-shaped reader to accommodate the four separate slots and it can do so without preventing other devices or wires from using any other ports nearby at the hub or at the back of the computer.The unit I received is well made and appears to be durable. I found it easy to take the various cards in and out and the same was true for plugging/unplugging the USB cable. With the USB wire hard-attached, the unit is very much self-contained which is a good thing because you won't be in a situation where you have the reader but can't find the wire to attach it.PERFORMANCEThe main factors that determine I/O speed is the actual speed of the card being read or written to. For example, an 8x rated CF card is about 15 times slower than a 133x CF card and no card reader or connecting the reader to a USB 3.0 port won't make it any faster. At the higher speeds other factors such as the USB port type (USB 2.0 vs. USB 3.0) and the computer's own CPU speed and the computer's workload at the time of transfer may slow down I/O through the reader.I did not measure measure data transfer speed because, unlike an HDD I/O which is important because hard disks are used all the time, card readers aren't used that often so an extra fraction of a second or a few extra seconds aren't that important. However, the performance on the several cards I tried appears to be reasonable and in line with expectations.WARRANTY AND SUPPORTThe makers promise an 18-month warranty from the date of purchase and provide email addresses and Web sites where any complaints may be registered. They promise to issue either a replacement or a refund on any item that had 'quality related issues'.Tech support appears to be provided at least initially via email. There is no phone number but they promise to reply to tech support related emails within one business day.RATINGI am compelled to rate this product as a five stars because it performs as expected, it's well designed, it appears to be durable and it appears to be well supported.","[0, 0]",Near-universal reader,2013,08, 25,,2933,501,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20130825

It's a large sound bar plus subwoofer and satellite speakers set that support just about any type of 'wired' connection including HDMI out with ARC and can also pair and play off Bluetooth supporting devices such as phones or tablets.Just to get it out of the way, I am going to start with the negatives, few as they are and will follow with a detailed description of what you are getting. So, here are the negatives:- Partially wired. The satellite speakers are in fact wired to the subwoofer, probably a small price to pay for true surround.- 5.1 surround, not 7.1 or 7.2. Yes, it's a sound bar, not a full surround speakers set.- Can't play off USB thumb drives or SD cards directly. You will need some Bluetooth device for that.And that's it, all the negatives I can think of so let me discuss the system overall.PRESENTATION AND PACKAGINGAs I noted above, this is a massive set and Vizio did an excellent job to get everything in a neatly organized box with all components clearly labeled and easy to locate. This is what's in the box:&#8729; the 54"" bar&#8729; subwoofer&#8729; 2 satellite speakers&#8729; remote control and batteries&#8729; cables: optical, stereo RCA 3.5 mm, coax, HDMI, 2 satellite speaker, 2 power cables&#8729; mounting hardware: 2 sound bar wall mount brackets, 2 sound bar wall mount lugs, 2 satellite speaker wall mount brackets, 2 satellite speaker wall mount lugs&#8729; wall mount template&#8729; 4 Velcro cable ties&#8729; Quick Start GuideAll of the above are quality items and I experienced near zero frustration getting them out of the box. Even better, just in case you may wish to return your purchase, there is a nice diagram on the box that shows exactly where everything is so, for as long as you don't destroy the Styrofoam it should be easy to get everything back in.SETUPGetting everything to work was quick and easy.The Manual is very well written and it covers and illustrates the speakers layout, mounting and how everything is connected. It explains clearly how to use the HDMI's ARC feature with your TV (make sure that the TV supports it if you are going to buy a new one) and how to wire several devices to the bar, taking advantage of its many ports.By the way, you get: RCA Analog Audio In, Optical, 3.5mm Analog Audio In, Digital Coax Audio In, HDMI Out (ARC), HDMI In and USB. And, of course you can pair wirelessly via Bluetooth. The bar supports aptX, allowing real-time streaming of high quality stereo audio over Bluetooth.OPERATIONThe set comes with a great, simple and effective remote control. It really comes down to selecting the proper input and then let it roar, so to speak. The manual explains how you can integrate the system into another 'universal' remote. I haven't tried that yet but it appears to be very much the standard remote 'learning' process.The subwoofer has a wireless link to the main bar which was properly set in my case but, just in case, there is a pair button also. All wires are properly labelled and, as I noted already, the manual explains how you can have several devices connected. All was quickly done for my experimental setup involving a TV and a gaming console.When paired with a Bluetooth device, your phone or tablet or laptop have complete control over what is playing on the bar.PERFORMANCEGetting to the final question of 'how does it sound', the brief answer is 'it sounds grrreat'. Thanks to the satellite speakers, this is true 5.1 surround, not a simulation and it's done through some good quality hardware.Talking specs, this is what you get:&#8729; Sound pressure Level (system): 104 dB&#8729; Frequency response (system): 45 Hz - 20 KHz&#8729; 2 3"" full range transducers (bar, one left and one right)&#8729; 2 3x6"" bass radiators&#8729; 3"" full range transducer (bar, center)&#8729; 2 3"" full range transducers (one per each satellite)SUPPORT AND WARRANTYVizio promises lifetime support for the product to cover setup, connecting and technical problems. They also have a one-year limited warranty.RATINGI have no choice but award Vizio's bar 5 stars because I love it. It's as close to ideal for anyone looking for a 'serious' bar to work with a large TV that delivers great surround and plays off mobile devices.","[8, 8]",Happy Hours at Vizio's Bar,2014,05, 29,1.0,4404,745,Positive,8,8,0,0.022667318026380067,20140529

I found it easy to take the various cards in and out and the same was true for plugging/unplugging USB cables. The unit is powered but there is no dedicated USB charging port. You 'can' charge through any of the 3 USB ports available but shouldn't get more on it than you'd get out of your computer's own powered USB slots.One issue with the AC power adapter - it's not designed to fit well on a power strip where it will probably occupy at least 2 slots but should be okay if plugged into a wall outlet.HooToo's device is light (2 oz.), quite small in size (3.31""*2.24""*0.94"") and easy to set.The distributors appear to be over-eager to please their customers. The manual promises a 12-month warranty and includes a '100% customer satisfaction' pledge.I would recommend HooToo's 3-port USB hub to anyone who doesn't need lots of extra USB ports - a 3-port USB hub only gains you 2 additional ports - and deals with various memory card types relatively frequently.

I never promise or even hint that accepting a free item for review will result in a 'good' review._________________________________________My home office requires 6 permanent USB connections: mouse, keyboard, speakers, webcam, two external HDDs. On top of that I need a couple extra ports for things I plug in and out such as a PKI token (VPN), minoHD cam, thumb drives and so on. To make it short, a 7-port USB hub makes a lot of sense if you have lots of USB-connected devices. Prior to HooToo's 7-port I could manage - used a 4-port hub and then ran a wire to the monitor that had 2 USB outputs and dedicate one and only one USB port for temporary plug-ins. Life was bearable but a 7-port makes life better.Now for usability and functionality: this is a powered hub and the power supply is included. It also comes with a USB cable you use to connect it to one of your computer's USB ports. It works flawlessly for me with devices connected on 6 out of the 7 available ports whether attached to a USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 port on the computer side. Yes, USB 3.0 is much faster but I can't say that I noticed any sluggishness when accessing my HDDs while connected via the USB 2.0 port.There is also a 5V/2A charging port which is nice but I'm not going to use it much because I'm dedicating the hub to 'permanent' USB connections and placing it out of sight and more or less out of reach.HooToo's hub is light (90g), relatively small (140*60*22 mm) considering the number of ports, easy to set and, while cased in plastic, it appears to be durable.The distributors appear to be over-eager to please their customers. The manual promised a 12-month warranty and includes a '100% customer satisfaction' pledge.I would recommend HooToo's 7-port USB hub to anyone with lots of USB-connected devices to handle the 'permanent' connections such as mouse, keyboard, HDD and so on. I would not recommend a hub for anything that requires a lot of bandwidth while connected because, ultimately, all 7 connected devices are going to share one USB connection into the computer.","[0, 0]",The Liberator,2013,05, 10,,2232,386,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20130510

My 5 stars rating reflect my view that this is a good product.BRIEF EVALUATIONPluggable's surge protector allows for up to 12 AC devices, including 4 'wide' DC adapters to be plugged in. It also has two, 2.1A (shared) USB charging ports. It will protect whatever is plugged in against power surges for as long as it is properly plugged and grounded itself. It does NOT protect or support coax, Ethernet or phone line connections.My personal experience does validate the claims the manufacturer makes for the features that I am using and I can verify at this time. I had no problem comfortabley plugging 10 devices, including 4 DC adapters and 6 2/3-prong plugs. The 2 remaining slots are unobstructed and could be used if needed.So far, I am happy and based on its meeting my real needs, good design, features and low price I recommend it as (in my view) one of the best it its class.MORE DETAILSThe following are noteworthy, in my view.Positives:- TRUE 12-outlet capacity. Unlike the traditional surge-protected power strips where one beefy AC adapter would cover 2 slots, Plugable's truly accommodates 4 AC adapters and allows for 8 more plugs to fit in.- 'Protected' and 'Grounded' status indicators (must be on) provides assurance that the surge protector is operational.- 6 ft. long cord, quite adequate.- Easy to close/open sliding cover for all outlets.- Flat shape. Stands well on a table or on the floor.- 4320 Joules protection is slightly higher than most competition.- Price appears to be slightly lower than most competition.Negatives:Nothing glaring other than the lack of some bombastic claim of ""$250,000.00 connected equipment warranty"" which some of the competing products make and which, once you read the fine print, turn out to be largely phony. But, seriously, I couldn't find a warranty statement in the box or a the maker's Web site. Oh... ""Plugable 12 Outlet Power Surge Protector with Built-in Dual USB Charging Ports for iPad, iPod, iPhone and other Devices"" is not the best name for a product. Yes, we all need that we can use a USB port to change our iPad, iPhone and 10,000 other devices. Should they all be mentioned in the product name? Just saying.SPECS (copied and pasted from the product's Web page)- For 120V AC / 60Hz (US plugs)- Capacity 15A, 1800 watts- Clamping voltage 330V- Max Spike Voltage 6,000V- Response time &lt; 1 ns- EMI/RFI Filter range 150Khz - 100 Mhz- EMI/RFI Filter Attenuation 58dBRATINGI couldn't find any glaring defects or omissions and the price is right. My expectations were met as far as, cord length and specs. My expectations were exceeded for design (it's pretty), the plugs layout with ample room for 4 wide adapters and the added convenience of 2 USB charging ports.Maybe I should have removed one star from the lack of an explicit warranty statement but my experience with the products within this price range is that warranties are largely meaningless. If the product breaks shortly after you purchase it you can easily send it back to Amazon. If it breaks after a few months then... good luck but you're not likely to be better off if some fine-print-heavy warranty statement is available._________________________________________NOTE: Regarding warrantyA brief email exchange with the maker reveals that, not surprisingly, they do offer a ""standard 1 year warranty against defective items/workmanship"".

I don't believe that it affects the content of my review or my final rating but it's fair to state it.I don't know if I qualify as an audiophile but I am definitely a sucker for good sound and can't stand the opposite. Within that context, the more little Bluetooth speakers I received for review, the more skeptical I've become on the wisdom of someone spending actually money to acquire such a device because the sound tends to be 'not good', their stereo rarely rises about the level of 'pretend', lack bass, the controls tend to look and feel cheap and some aren't much louder than the phone's or tablet's own built in speakers. Yes, there are exceptions but they almost always tend to be on the 'high end' of the price spectrum.Enter EasyAcc's entry. It's somewhat midrange pricewise and yet it delivers some very, very good quality, crisp, loud, stereo sound with decent bass. And it's quite good looking too if appreciate the Zeppelin shape. The explanation for my Four Stars rating is because 'sound' matters to me so much vs. everything else so I am really subtracting about 3 stars for other issues but the EasyAcc starts with a seven stars rating for its sound - unbelievably good for a device this size at this price point.Here is the list of features that are likely to disappoint you and could make you to look elsewhere if they are important to you. All based on my experience, of course.- Terrible, awkward interface. There is a Mode button that switches between Bluetooth and other modes such as Radio, line mode or USB/SD card but it's difficult to know where you are because there are no visual clues whatsoever except for some pulsating blue light that should indicate that the device is paired or about to pair via Bluetooth.- Radio didn't work for for me. We don't get too many stations here but EasyAcc got me none. Don't know why. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way of storing favorite stations. Going back to the interface, the manual claims that it can store up to 35 FM stations but I am unaware on how to store them and, since there is no visual feedback, assuming that stations can be stored, it should be impossible to determine which stored stations you are currently listening to, its frequency and it shouldn't be that easy to switch from, let's say 'station 5' to 'station 25'.- USB/AC card interface doesn't work. I plugged in a USB stick I use to play music in my car and plays well on both Windows and Android devices but nothing came out. As far as I can tell, IF this could be made to work, there is no random play mode, no way to search for a specific album or artist and no way to switch to another song other than sequentially move from 'song 1' to 'song 2' and so forth.- Standby time of only 18 hours. If you turn it on it's likely to stay on until the battery runs out, regardless of it receiving any input.But enough negativity. There are some other good thing to note, besides the great sound:+ Comes with a pretty good 800 mAh lithium battery that charges off any USB charger.+ USB charging wire and 3.5 mm audio cable included.+ Can play while charging+ Supports headphonesTo summarize: sound is great for something this small and it makes up for almost all shortcomings. It's also pretty.

It's also fair to note that I didn't promise a 'good review' in exchange and Brightech didn't ask for one.You can plug up to 7 USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 devices and they are all going to share one of your computer's USB ports and my experience shows that you never have enough USB ports. There is a status light for each port (nice, especially if you like to see 'lights' on your devices) and two of the seven do double-duty as USB charging ports. This is possible thanks to the large 5V/4A AC adapter that should supply enough power for a few attached HDDs (I had two) with enough left to charge... whatever. The charging ports switch to 'fast charging' mode whenever your computer is sleeping or off and can output up to 1.A each.Off the box, you get the hub itself, the above-mentioned AC adapter and a USB 3.0 cable.This would have been a 5-star product if it weren't for a few, very minor issues: at 3 ft., the AC adapter cord is a little too short at least for my setup, the shiny black finish seems to love collecting my fingerprints and somewhat reluctant to let them go when I try wiping them off, the bulky AC adapter may be difficult to squeeze into some power strips. None of the above is necessarily 'bad' or it's probably not a big deal for most but I thought I'd mentioned it so there aren't post-buy surprises.Four stars mean ""I like it"" and it's pretty close to ""I love it"".

You will be able to get a 32GB Nexus 7 for the price of the current 16GB model.NOTE:My initial review was a Nexus 7 vs. the first generation Kindle Fire and the Nexus was a clear winner. I have now updated my review for the Fire HD. It's a close call but the Nexus' 4-core CPU and its pure Android, more open makeup make it my preferred 7-incher. However, the rest of my family prefers the Fire HD because it's such a great dedicated (Amazon) media consumption pad._______________________________________________We've been using a Kindle Fire since September 2011 (pre-ordered)  and I am happy we ordered ours. Soon after purchase it was adopted by our daughter. She is using it to draw and paint, she watches Netflix for Kids on it, she learned how to search Youtube for arts and crafts 'how to' videos and she plays (mostly free) games from Amazon's Appstore. The Fire wasn't a full-feature tablet when it launched but we overlooked its hardware shortcomings, its off-mainstream Android and its locking us out Google's much larger app store because the price was right and because the 7"" screen size made it lighter and more portable than the 'full size' 10.1"" alternatives. We are still happy with our Fire but we are happier with Nexus 7, our second 7"" tablet.Because Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle are both Android tablets very similar in screen size that sell for the same price, I am going to compare the two while I write about my experience with Nexus 7. Whenever appropriate, I will note the differences between Nexus and the Fire when such differences exist. If a feature is present on both tablets I will simply note its existence. I will prefix specific features with an equal sign if both tablets support it equally, a plus sign if the Nexus implementation is superior or Fire lacks it and a minus sign when a feature is better implemented by Fire or is a Fire exclusive.HARDWARE (Nexus 7 but it's a close call)The Nexus comes pretty close to what we normally call the latest and greatest (written in July 2012).+ GPS (Fire lacks it)+ Quad-core CPU vs. Fire's dual-core- 16/32GB models for Kindle vs. 16/32GB for Nexus- Dual-antenna for Wi-Fi on Kindle vs. one antenna on Nexus= Accelerometer= Backlit screen at 1280x800 are identical in specs and looks= Front-facing camera on both= Gyroscope= Micro USB port= Microphone on bothNeither the Fire or the Nexus come with memory expansion ports or a rear-facing camera. The Micro USB interface will allow you to attach flash drives and even powered USB HDDs but the fact remains that if you buy an Nexus 7 or a Kindle Fire HD you are stuck with built in amount of internal storage. At the same time, I will testify that I haven't used 8GB yet on my much older 16GB XOOM. A rear-facing camera would have been a plus.CONNECTIVITY (Nexus 7)The better connected a tablet is, the more useful it becomes. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD lack 3G/4G capabilities (Amazon will have a very expensive 4G model later this year), relying mostly on Wi-Fi to stay in touch with the world but there are some differences between the two worth noting.= WiFi 802.11 b/g/n= Amazon's Appstore= Bluetooth+ Near Field Communication (Fire lacks it) It allows two devices that support it to exchange information by touching each other. Not widely used at this time.+ Google Play (Fire restricts access to Amazon's Appstore only)I listed the app stores under connectivity mostly because Amazon made it impossible (unless you hack your Fire) to shop from anywhere other than Amazon's own store and I believe you are confined to Amazon's cloud services. There are no such restrictions on the Nexus. You can use Amazon's cloud, Google's or anyone else's if you so desire.SOFTWARE (Nexus 7)+ Android. Nexus 7 comes with Android 4.1 pre-installed, the latest version at the time I write this. It is very likely that it will be upgradeable to future versions. At the same time, it is not likely that the Fire's custom Android 3.x will ever be upgraded. It's possible but not likely.+ Chrome. It happens to be my favorite browser. Amazon does not allow Chrome on its Fire. Fire's own browser is not too bad but I personally prefer Chrome.= Flash. Nexus 7 or Android 4.1 rather does not support Flash which is too bad but it's because Adobe decided not to support it on Android 4.1. Kindle Fire HD does not appear to support Flash either.BUILD (a tie)I like both tablets look and feel. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD are strikingly beautiful tablets. One little issue for the Fire is its too well hidden power and volume controls but it's something that's likely to be annoying for the first few days only, until reaching for them becomes second nature.PRICE (Fire HD but it's a close call)The Fire HD appears is the less expensive one on the 16GB configuration but the difference is not as big as it may seem. Keep in mind that the Fire comes without a charger so you will have to buy one separately and you will have to pay Amazon some more if you don't want to see ads on it.MY CONCLUSIONSI've been using a Nexus 7 for over a month at the time I'm writing this. I've also been using a Kindle Fire HD for about a week now. I am fully aware that when it comes to 'tablets' the technology changes fast and I have little doubt that it will be surpassed by many newer models but, at the time I'm writing this, I have a personal preference for the Nexus 7 even though I enjoy using the Fire HD and they are nearly on par when it comes to 'media consumption' activities with the Fire HD clearly in the lead when the content's is Amazon.Neither the Nexus or the Fire are perfect. Both tablets, for example, lack memory expansion capabilities and a back camera. However, the Nexus, while selling for the about the same price, beats the Fire in every single category but it's a close call. If you are an Amazon person (like I am) the Nexus gives you the best of both worlds. You can still get your Amazon Appstore and the Kindle reader app but nothing restricts you from using someone else's store. The Fire HD erased the Nexus advantage on Bluetooth, camera and microphone. Amazon's new tables now match the Nexus 7 for many features and they even beat the Nexus on some (Wi-Fi, internal storage). In my case, I will continue to use the Nexus 7 but the rest of the family prefers the Kindle Fire HD.>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;___________________________________________NOTE ON STORAGE (memory)We are doing just fine with our 8GB Kindle Fire and our Nexus 7 is a 8GB model. I went for the 8GB model for 2 reasons: my year-plus experience with a 8GB Kindle Fire and a 16GB XOOM and, I must admit, a 16GB model wasn't available at the store  when I bought my Nexus.I agree that 16GB is always better than 8GB and a tablet with a SD card slot is better than one without. Objectively, 8GB may be okay for most of us but not all of us. Our 8GB Fire is less than half-full today and I never needed an SD card for our 16GB XOOM because, after more than a year, I have 4.8GB worth of Apps, 1GB worth of pictures and videos (all pics and videos I took with the XOOM) and 0.2GB worth of Audio.Had I decided to download my music library and the family photo albums on a tablet, 16GB might have been barely adequate and I would have used the SD memory expansion but I never felt that need. With videos coming from Youtube or movie streaming services and most of my music streaming from Pandora or cloud storage or our dedicated Media Server, 8GB appear to be okay (barely) and 16GB are quite plenty. Of course this may not be the case 2 years from now.I would buy the 16GB model if I was planning on storing lots of content other than apps on my tablet or simply wanted 'peace of mind' as in not worry about managing my tablet's storage. If not planning to keep lots of photos or videos or music on the Nexus then the 8GB may be just fine.","[1288, 1346]",Nexus 7 vs. Kindle Fire HD (updated),2012,08, 2,0.9569093610698366,7998,1431,Positive,1288,1346,58,0.062465396515225535,20120802

Before I forget, it was provided to me as a 'for review' unit at no cost but UtechSmart understands that my reviews and my ratings are fully and completely independent and did not ask for a 'good review' in exchange.There are exactly two reasons one may need this little USB-connected plug-in:- your computer doesn't have Bluetooth support built-in- your computer doesn't support BT 4.0 and you would like to upgrade to Bluetooth's latest and greatest (supports Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth high speed and Bluetooth low energy protocols)My test machine was a Windows 7 laptop that lacked Bluetooth support but had plenty of USB ports. By the way, the makers state that Windows XP and above up to Windows 8 are supported. Plug and play worked well - the device was recognized and self-installed and configured in less than 15 seconds. Once Bluetooth was added, the computer was able to recognize and quickly pair with a Bluetooth mouse and a keyboard.For your money, you get the little adapter itself (based on Broadcom's BCM20702 chipset), a little manual and an installation CD that I didn't have to use on Windows 7 but may be useful with other versions of Windows.The very small form factor should make this adapter ideal for used with Windows laptops for as long as there is a USB port available. Sure, some mice come with their own custom non-Bluetooth USB dongles that are equally small but a generic Bluetooth adapter had the advantage of allowing simultaneous pairing with a variety of BT-compliant peripherals.The adapter works well, was easy to install and use on a Windows 7 machine, comes in the right form/size and, at the time I am writing this, the price appears to be in line with similar offers from other vendors.","[2, 2]",Little thing means a lot,2013,08, 20,1.0,1819,311,Positive,2,2,0,0.02247191011235955,20130820

Seriously, it look good and it should make it easier to identify the HDMI cable at the back of your entertainment cabinet if your wiring is like the mess I have at the back of mine. Some vendors also claim that braided cables get extra shielding. This may or may not be true but it doesn't matter unless you want a cable that would continue to deliver you video during an EMP burst event.Get this one if you like it braided and don't mind spending a couple of extra dollars or get the equally good but plain9To5Cables High Speed Ultra HDMI Cable with Ethernet (6 Feet)] or any other HDMI wire that has a good price and good reviews.HOW GOOD IS IT?- Supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.What you get is what emerged as the standard, full-featured HDMI 1.4 cable. The HDMI consortium defined 4 main types of HDMI of which the ""High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet"" is the de-facto standard that everyone is selling because no one has much use for the lesser configurations. This allows everyone to call their wires 'High Speed' which is very much meaningless since practically all HDMI cables are 'high speed' these days. The 'Ultra' in this cable name means probably 'nothing', it's just branding.These being said, the price is right and you are getting a good, standard HDMI cable for you money. The one I've received behaved well.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 was adopted in 2009 and it's backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.HDMI 1.4 allows for the following features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetStandard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.","[0, 0]",Some like it braided.,2013,11, 2,,4731,793,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20131102

It comes bundled with an AC charger and a standard Type-A to Micro USB cable that can be used with the charger or to transfer data to/from a computer. Besides the Micro USB port it also has an SD card slot to add storage or to quickly share photos if the SD card came from a camera.The Connect 64G worthy features include:- The 1500 mAh Li-polymer battery can provide as much as 8 hours of uptime.- Content can be loaded from a PC. On a Windows computer the Connect 64G appears as an attached drive with a number of folders (Video, Photos, Music) already created and populated with some sample and instructional items.- Android, Kindle tablets and iOS phones and tablets that have installed the the proper app available at Apple's or Amazon's App Stores or Google Play can connect to the Wi-Fi network created by Connect 64G and play any of the stored media files if those formats are supported by their devices- While your tablet is connected to 64G's own Wi-Fi network, you can set it to support your 'normal' network as well so you can watch a video off the 64G and browse the Web with no need to specifically connect to your home network.- SanDisk claims that up to 8 devices can stream simultaneously and up to 5 HD video streams are possible. I wasn't able to test the '8 simultaneous devices' claim myself but, as the attached poor quality video shows, it had no problem streaming to 3 devices of which one was playing at 1080p.But of course, there must be some tradeoffs in a relatively inexpensive device and here they are, sorted from the least to the most troubling:- USB port is slow. It's USB 2.0 and the best it could do on my 4-core, rather speedy laptop was 4 MB/s when transferring a large file.- 64G may sound like a lot but it's not if you expect to stream HD video out of the device. Depending on the file format, half a dozen full length movies at 1080p would be the upper limit. But then there is also 'DVD quality' video and, of course, you could double or even triple the storage if you buy a large enough SD card.- The SanDisk Wireless Media Drive app is asking for intrusive permissions such as: ""read phone status and identity"" and ""modify your contacts, read call log, read your contacts, write call log"" and silly ones such as ""set wallpaper"".To my surprise, the more I use this little gadget, the more I like it, and I've been using it for about a month from now. It proved its worth during a long family trip when kids loaded it up with whatever they though they'd be watching while on the road and we had some happy kids.I will be rating this a four stars because I really like it. The SanDisk app, intrusive as it is (there goes one star), will be used rarely (on long trips) and will only be used by us on Wi-Fi tablets so most of app's curiosity won't be satisfied.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[0, 0]",Little private cloud,2013,09, 15,,3120,577,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20130915

I couldn't resist grabbing a new Nexus 7 and taking it home for a test drive this morning because there's always room for a new gadget in our household (kids ranging from 5th grad to college-bound). Quite a task, given that I also brought along with me Google's Chromecast. I couldn't say that the new N7 'blew my mind' because I've been using one of the older N7 models for quite a while but, what an improvement this is.Let me start with the bad news first and there's only one significant item: still no SD card slot. At this time I suspect no Nexus device will ever have one because Google wants us to use their cloud services and maybe I will when I am satisfied that that my data is both safe and private there but this is a debate worth having another time and in a different context so let me focus on some of the obvious improvements, whatever I can detect after half a (sunny) day of playing with the N7 by the pool. I am sure that there are many subtle ones that I will become aware of as I get to know it better.&#725; It APPEARS to be smaller than the old N7. The screen seems to be the exact same size the but the bezels are thinner. So it IS smaller.&#725; It feels lighter. Not by a lot but I quite am sure that it weighs less than the old N7.&#725; It lasted the whole day of one charge and, at the end of the day it still has some juice left. I did mostly browsing and exploring features but I did watch maybe a couple of hours of HD video as well.&#725; Android 4.3 allows for separate user accounts and the ability to restrict access to certain accounts. FINALLY!!&#725; Improved parental controls (see above).&#725; It's faster. A LOT FASTER than the previous model and 'faster' translates in significantly more responsive switching between apps and I noticed a better response to touch inputs. And it breezes through 3D games.&#725; Dual cameras. 1.2 megapixel front-facing, 5 megapixel rear-facing. Quite decent, will probably use them a lot on this vacation.&#725; AWESOME sound. Sorry, but I had to use that word because it is so. The old N7 wasn't that bad either but this is probably the bestest I've heard in a tablet of this size.&#725; Dual-band Wi-Fi. Looks like everybody does it this days and I'm glad they do.&#725; 1920x1200 screen resolution - saving the best for last. I don't want to compare it with anyone else's product but this is an enormous improvement over the previous N7. 323 pixel density per inch is something I've seen in the highest end phones but it's, I'm quite sure, a first in a 7-inch tablet.What does this add up to? The sweetest 7-incher this little money can buy today, for sure. Unless you feel that an SD card is a 'must have'. I really don't because there are other good ways to store and access movies but they have a 32GB model too.","[1, 1]",The new and sweet - I mean... improved - N7,2013,07, 27,1.0,2894,534,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20130727

But, one month later, I can say that I am in love with this camera and I am actually using it in instances where I would normally take shots with a phone or a small point-and-shoot AND in most instances where I would have brought a DSLR before I had a the opportunity to try out this LUMIX.This being my first Panasonic camera of any kind, learning it wasn't easy but, after taking some time getting used to it, it does become 'second nature', eventually. It took me about one month to advance from the basic 'all auto' settings to maybe half-way to 'pro' skills and, not being a professional photographer, I may not advance much farther. I can already take near-perfect HD video with clear stereo sound, macro photos, beautiful low-light shots and, with a tripod, I did a pretty good portrait of the Moon at 60x zoom and max res. I am currently experimenting with a third-party flash and I continue to be impressed by my output's quality and the ease of getting it that way.Of course, not everything is perfect. Yes, it's not a DSLR and it doesn't support Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or 'location', meaning that you will be transferring your work out either through a wire or a card reader adapter and you'll have to make a not of where the photo was taken - I personally don't care much about these features but no everyone is 'me' so it's worth stating it. I also do notlike the non-standard USB cable for data transfer but I'm using a card reader anyway so yes, it's bad but not too bad.Not a negative at all because it's customary, but it's worth noting that you need to supply your own carrying case, memory card because the 300MB or so built in won't take you too far.I like this LUMIX a lot and after all these years of juggling between phones and point-and-shoot and DSLRs for 'serious' events or happenings, I may just stick with the 'bridge' because it's so much fun to use while giving me almost everything I could squeeze out of a DSLR and often more: incredible zoom power, movies and microphone quality, flexibility in setting picture format and resolution.","[8, 8]","A good, good, good (bridge) camera",2013,12, 18,1.0,3432,614,Positive,8,8,0,0.022667318026380067,20131218

The may reason I am happy is clearly 'price'.The NW680 does almost everything Canon's own, except maybe for lacking a Slave Mode and, as far as I can tell, and I am NOT a pro, it does it equally well. Yes, it's a little bulkier and maybe not as good looking as some of the Canon Speedlite equivalents but you could buy three or four of NEEWER's for the amount you'd pay for Cannon's least expensive equivalent.SETUP AND OPERATIONThanks to the nice instruction manual, setup was a breeze. Yes, you must supply your own set of AA alkaline batteries (and I am still using the initial set after taking a couple hundred photos with it) but that's not surprising considering the product's low price.Mounting and getting it to work with the camera was a breeze.Someone like me, would probably always use the 'auto' mode but more sophisticated photographers can easily pick Tv (set shutter speed manually), Av (manually control aperture) or M (control both manually).OTHER FEATURES AND CAPABILITIESI may only be scratching the surface here but, thanks to the manual, I was able to quickly master Bounce Flash techniques where you can point the flash head toward the ceiling or a wall so that light would bounce from there on the subject rather than illuminating them directly. You can also create a Catchlight effect with the built-in wide panel and so on.More control is afforded by allowing you to manually set the flash output from anywhere between 1/128 power to full power.Some interesting special effects can be produced in the Multi mode such as Stroboscopic flashes.Everything I did in auto mode came out great.OVERALL EXPERIENCESuch an affordable and yet near 'pro-level' flash should be ideal for anyone in the process experimenting and learning more about their Canon DSLR. Speaking for myself, the NW680 is very much what I will ever want/need, at least for the foreseeable future as it works well with my camera and addresses nearly all of my needs in AUTO mode.","[17, 19]","Big Size, Small Price",2013,11, 4,0.8947368421052632,2157,372,Positive,17,19,2,0.022895293926070672,20131104

I never promise or even hint that accepting a free item for review will result in a 'good' review._________________________________________Many of us, I imagine, are short of USB ports these days or wished they had more. The laptop on which I'm writing this has three of them but only two are USB 3.0 and I need more. Which is where a 'hub' can help.Utech's product is a one piece port multiplier - you get 3 extra USB 3.0 ports, 4 in total which, by the way, are fully compatible with USB 2.0. You can use it to connect anything that doesn't rely on the USB connection for power but it would be a poor choice for charging your devices. You benefit from the USB 3.0's much higher speed when compared to USB 2.0 but, of course, the bandwidth is going to be shared among the 4 ports when they are in use.The hub is light (15g), relatively small (75*42 mm) and thin (11mm) considering the number of ports. It's easy to set and, while cased in plastic, it appears to be durable. The short USB cable interface is permanently attached to the body which should ensure that you can always use it when you need it.UtechSmart appears to be over-eager to please their customers. According to their Web site, they offer an unconditional 30-day refund policy or replacement for any reason. There is a standard 18-month warranty period during which they promise to fix anything that's not the outcome of misuse or abuse.Due to its small form factor, this hub should be a good pick when traveling for as long as 'powered' USB interfaces are not needed.","[0, 0]",Small is practical,2013,09, 8,,1709,297,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20130908

I did need to supply my own Phillipa screwdriver.Once the stand is together, finishing the job is as easy as attaching the two VESA-compatible monitors. Most monitors are compatible these days and you will know them because they have 4 holes matching the stand's on VESA plate on their back. Final adjustments involve sliding the two-arms assembly on the vertical holding rod to the proper height, extending the arms and setting the monitors at the proper orientation.

All I can say is that I wasn't able to detect any smell myself. I also saw claims that this is a 'cardboard' cover. I didn't tear it apart but Moshi states that the cover was ""constructed out of durable, polycarbonite sheets (no cardboard was used in the construction of this case)"".While it didn't win me over, the 'reading stand' capability, it being lighter and the lower price make this a compelling candidate for one's favorite Kindle cover.

It helps that the subwoofer is wireless. There are inputs for optical (5 ft. cable provided), coax (bring your own cable) or analog stereo (3.5 mm stereo mini plug provided).The unit is operated either through on-bar controls or via the supplied remote control or you can set the TV remote controller to work with it and the manual is good at explaining what you need to do to make it work.OPERATIONBy default, the sound bar will go in standby mode if it receives no input for about 5 minutes so you don't need to worry about turning it off.The supplied remote controls volume on both the bar and the subwoofer, can mute them if needed and can switch input between TV, USB and Bluetooth. It also allows for switching the sound mode between 'music', 'news' and a more 3D-surround-like 'movie' mode. All remote-supported functions can be performed by pressing buttons on the sound bar itself.One of this bar's great features is Bluetooth integration. It only takes seconds to pair it with anything Bluetooth and there you have it, near-perfect rendition of whatever your tablet or phone can get out of your cloud or locally-stored music collection, Pandora or whatever service for as long as you can play it on your device. It's sweet.USB flash drive playback is also supported but you have little control beyond skipping to the next song or stop/start. It only plays MP3 files that reside at your flash drive's 'root' which is NOT where my music is because files tend to be placed in folders and organized by artists and albums. The USB feature is limited but it's also largely not needed. It won't be missed because you can always play your flash drive-stored music off your laptop, tablet or phone via Bluetooth and nearly all laptops and even some tablets will allow you to play off flash drives.THE LISTENING EXPERIENCEYes, sound bars aren't quite as good as properly placed speakers in a 7.2 surround setup but this Onkyo bar comes pretty, pretty close and you don't need to worry about a dedicated receiver and wiring. I am not going to replace what I already have wired in the living room but there is a sitting room/gaming room for which this sound bar would be quite the ideal solution, sacrificing a little bit of surround purity for a lot less setup headaches.I should state that what's inside seems to be great quality speakers and the 3D surround simulation in movie mode is quite amazing and you don't have to be in some precise spot in front to experience it or most of it.RATINGIt's a five star for value and quality, the great sound rendering and the nice movie mode 3D surround simulation, simple setup and ease of operation.","[6, 7]",Welcome to Onkyo's Sound Bar (listen responsibly),2013,12, 24,0.8571428571428571,3158,554,Positive,6,7,1,0.02256961406936981,20131224

So here are my thoughts on the set.QUALITY AND DESIGNAlmost everything is right. The set is built on a light-weight, aluminum body that looks good while being strong. There is sufficient padding on the headband to make wearing it comfortable and the ear pads can be removed for cleaning if needed. The arms slide to allow for height adjustment and can fold for storage.You get THREE cables and the set comes with a very nice, zippered, black and red hard case that will hold and protect your earphones and has an internal, also zippered pocket for cables and whatever other accessories.Of the several headphones sets I had the opportunity to review recently, this is one of the more beautiful and well put together.THE LISTENING EXPERIENCEIf a range of 10 Hz - 24 kHz doesn't tell the whole story (see more specks below) and it doesn't, then I will share my subjective views. I tried the set with everything from Bach concertos to Evanescence live big sound and a lot of in-between and I can't recall any disappointments. The phenomenal frequency range is enhanced by the 40 mm dynamic drivers and, my impression was that, except for just a little bass enhancement which doesn't affect classical much and truly makes rock tunes... rock, the sound stays honestly and effortlessly true to the source. It's a near-perfect balance between acutes, mids and bass with, like I said just a tiny bass bias.The HM9s are advertised as 'noise isolating' headphones, which is exactly what they are. There are no artificial noise cancelling artifacts to be found but noise isolate they do simply through the generous padding and the relatively large ear pads.The most I've spent with the HM9s at any given time was about 40-50 minutes of listening and, for that amount of time, I didn't feel any discomfort so I would rate the set as 'comfortable' or 'easy to wear'.SPECS AND CONTENTS- Driver: dynamic, 40 mm- Rated impedance: 40 Ohms- Frequency range: 10 Hz - 24 kHz- Sensitivity: 104 dB at 1 mW- Max input power: 1000 mW- Plugs: 3.5 mm, gold-plated- Detachable cables: 1.2m & 3m flat cables, 1.2m cable with in-line micAs noted above, the set comes with three cables. In addition, you also get a 2-prong airplane adapter so you won't depend on the horror earphones the flight attendants provide. And, of course, a very nice, very protective and very well designed hard case.RATINGThe set outputs high-quality audio, is comfortable, looks great and appears to be durable.

And they didn't ask for a 'good' review either. So, here is my Android PC education. Not being a full 'geek', I will discuss the product mostly from the point of view of usability as in ""what is it good for"" or ""what can I do with it"" rather than get too much into raw specs or arcane features. I suspect that I will be updating my review as I learn and understand more about the product so that someone may be able to benefit from my experience.WHAT IS IT?The MK908 II has everything that you can see if you click on ""See more product details"" in the Product Features sections which is quite impressive, considering its small size and weight. Worth mentioning is the quad-core CPU, ports such as HDMI, USB and a MicroSD card slot for memory expansion.It comes with its own power adapter that takes one of the 2 USB ports, has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, supports 1080p output.For software, it comes to Android 4.2.2 installed and a few, mostly Chinese-made apps besides the expected Google suite.HOW DOES IT WORK?You connect the power adapter to the MK908 and you use the supplied HDMI wire to connect to a monitor, a TV or the receiver to which a TV is attached. If all if well then you will soon see the Android main screen on your monitor or TV.To control it initially you can use a USB corded mouse or any of the wireless mice or mouse/keyboard/touchpad combos that come with their own dongle. You then set up Wi-Fi and anything else you would set on an Android tablet and you are very much good to go.It is possible to use a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard after the initial setup. I've done it and all was great until I turned it off. When it came back up, it did not pair with the mouse and had to re-discover it (had to plug in a USB corded mouse to navigate Android) before I could use that mouse again. I emailed the makers for an explanation but haven't received one yet.WHAT CAN I DO WITH IT?You can log into Google's store and install and run any Android app that doesn't insist that you touch the screen to make it work. You can also use either the supplied browser that supports Flash or install Google's Chrome.Installing apps such as Netflix or Google's Youtube will get you easy access to a lot of HD content. Off the box, it quickly found SMB servers on my home network and had not problem playing VOB content. Since this is not 'big screen' hardware, Youtube allowed playing 'restricted' content such as music videos. Off the browser I could play quite any streaming TV stations with quite a decent 'full screen' rendition.If you expand storage through the MicroSD card you should be able to keep your own local library. There also seems to be a capability of reading off a connected SATA HDD but I haven't tried that yet because I don't have a long enough HDMI table to place the MK908 on a shelf with the HDD next to it. I would be surprised if the SATA drive didn't have to be under its own power for this to work.WHAT CAN'T I DO WITH IT?Mostly playing any 'touch' games. Yes, you can probably try a touchpad but don't expect to go too far in Temple Run that way. I haven't tried attaching a camera or a microphone yet so that may or may not work.HOW DOES IT COMPARE?Going by physical size and price, the Roku and Google's Chromecast come to mind.When compared to the Roku, the MK908 had the ability to play off a browser session and, of course, it can access Youtube in full hi-res. Roku, of course, has the channels and the pay services. When it comes to 'pay', you can basically get on the MK908 anything that you'd get on an Android tablet, meaning that you won't get Amazon's Prime video service at this time which is available on Roku.MK908 vs. the Chromecast... Yes, the MK908 can cast any tab and since it pulls the stream directly from the Internet, it can play content smoother and at a higher resolution. The Chromecast method is less efficient on anything that's not 'supported' which currently is anything that's not Youtube or Google Play. The MK908 can also access content (SD card, SATA drive possibly, SMB servers) that Chromecast either can't get or can't play it efficiently at this time as it's 'off the browser' resolution is limited to 720p and you need a pretty speedy computer for that to work (the best I could get was 480p). The Chromecast, on the other hand, can be easier to operate since it can be controlled from Windows computers, Android phones or tablets and, I believe Apple devices and does not need some dedicate mouse or airmouse or wireless keyboard or touchpad.HOW IS THE MK908 SUPPORTED?Good question. Like I said, I'm not a full-blown geek but I tend to get gadgets do what I want them to do, eventually. My view is that it's not 'too hard' to get this running and, once you do get it running it should not be too hard to operate. I will soon attach the MK908 to our living room receiver and will do so once the wireless mouse I ordered for arrives. I will update my review then.","[9, 11]",Warming up to the Android PC concept (my education),2013,10, 1,0.8181818181818182,5087,937,Positive,9,11,2,0.022634750040709983,20131001

Elastic bands allow for the corner grips to tightly keep your tablet tightly bound with all the ports and buttons exposed for as long as they don't have them on the corners.With the tablet safely attached, the product literally wraps around it providing better protection than just about any stand/case I am aware of and the 'professional' look is an added bonus. It took a while to figure out how to fold the panels to make up a stand but once we figured it out we ended up with a variable viewing angle stand that can be configured for just viewing or typing.The keyboard itself was easy to pair with our Kindle Fire and all keys, including the various media-specific special functions worked as expected. They keys are nicely spaced for a keyboard this size and they feel good to the touch. The keyboard's built-in battery can be charged by any USB charger (not provided) through the included USB cable. For a 'duh' comment, some of the special functions such as the various 'media' commands (stop, skip, pause) and the pairing function are invoked by holding the blue Fn key and then pressing the key that has the desired function in blue. Many keyboards are designed this way and this is no exception. As far as compatibility, this is a Bluetooth keyboard. It should pair itself with most devices that support Bluetooth but it will not work with tablets that do not support it. Pairing it and getting it to work with a Kindle Fire took about 5 seconds.I am very pleased with Belkin's product. Yes, it does add a significant amount of weight to your tablet but, if 'typing' is something that you do frequently on it and you enjoy your tablet looking like a super-tiny laptop, the keyboard plus the great protection and the viewing stand and the good looks should make it worth it. A star goes off for the poorly explained and illustrated method of setting it up as as viewing stand, source of some frustration but, once you master it, you are likely to like it.","[1, 1]",Significant expansion and protection justify added weight,2014,06, 2,1.0,2359,422,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20140602

Hmmm... I wish my shoes were done that way because it's a lot more likely that I wear shoes when my phone needs charging than that I have a mouse around.Other than that, it's a decent wireless mouse. Worked with Windows 7 and Windows 8 computers and, to my surprise, it even worked with our Chromebooks. You simply plug the dongle into the USB port and you got a working mouse. The 2700 mAh battery does not seem to add a lot of weight and the mouse handles well. It seems to fit slightly larger than average hands and it has a right-hand bias even though I should be useable left-handed as well. I liked the rubberized sides.You can use the charging port to store the dongle when not in use which makes the mouse almost self-contained. The micro-USB charging wire can be used to both charge the mouse off a standard USB charger (not included) and to charge any phone or rather 'anything' that can be charged through an micro-USB port.

It supports Bluetooth 4.0 and I was able to easily pair it with various tablets, laptops, Chromebooks and phones without any issues. When paired with a phone it does 'hands free' and it will pick up/hang up, allow you to reject a call or put it on hold, even do voice dial. It supports pairing with 2 phones which is good.The simple control buttons are large enough to be easy to find and they are easy to 'feel', therefore useful if you need to control your speaker at times when your eyes are focused elsewhere, as in when you're driving.As I already noted, the sound is 'good' but not quite 'great'. As it's often the case with small speakers, the bass is at best 'best effort' and the unit that I received also seems to struggle a little with high acutes.

It immediately replaced a not-so-old Linksys EA4500 and made its Cisco RE1000 Wireless-N Range Extender buddy no longer needed. As of now, there's no going back. A good router is essential to us because, as a 'cable or rather satellite TV cutter' household, we are dependent on the Internet everything from VPN into my workplace network when telecommuting to keeping our workouts updated on the treadmill and a lot in between: movie streaming, phone service, Web browsing, gaming, printers, tablets, readers, radios, you name it. A good router is so important, I always keep at least two, preconfigured and ready to go backup units at any given time but the Nighthawk is going to be the primary one until something better comes around, of course.THE NIGHTHAWKOne important and very good question and the concern I had myself was the one having to do with 'how hard/easy is it to set it up and get it going?' so I will describe that first.Netgear's new router was running literally within minutes after its arrival. It does look a little bit intimidating as you take it out of its box with its large size, three serious antennas and stealth-fighter inspired looks but, once 'lunch time' came, I simply unplugged everything off the Linksys, plugged it into the the Nighthawk and followed the quick setup instructions from the small (16-page) manual. The large manual has to be downloaded but wasn't needed.As soon as it lit up, the preset Wi-Fi network became visible and I was able to connect to it from my laptop. I could then access 'Genie', the management utility that resides on the router itself and can be installed in a more 'user-friendly' form as an app from Netgear's site and I found myself using both. From within Genie I quickly changed the network name (SSID) and password to exactly to match exactly what I had on the Linksys and, within minutes, almost everything in our house was connected to the new router and, by the time the lunch break was over and I had to go back to work, I was back on the VPN through Nighthawk. Mission accomplished.A few 'first impression' words/advice before I move to the extra setup that followed:&#725; Be prepared to deal with something physically big. Really big. The Nighthawk is easily the largest home router I've ever seen and, if you are going to plug a couple of HDDs into it, make sure you reserve enough room.&#725; Take some time getting acquainted with Genie. There is a Genie you get from the router itself and then there's an app you install and while most things can be done through either, the interfaces are different and some features can be accessed only from one of the Genies.&#725; Incremental works best. Don't try to do everything at once. I had a very happy setup experience by duplicating what my previous router was doing first, and only after that expanding into new capabilities, one at a time.CURRENT SETUP (the present)This is what the Nighthawk (aka Nighthawk AC1900 Smart WiFi Router Model R7000) does for us at this time:&#725; Dual band: it supports 2.4GHz b/g/n and 5GHz a/n/ac. Not all devices work on both bands but by manually setting up those that can use both, they should be able to use the one which provides better service at any given time - I named the 5GHz SSID the same as the 2.4GHz with a -5G suffix added and used the same password for both.&#725; Security: anything up to WPA/WPA2 Enterprise is supported. We settled for WPA2-PSK [AES] because it works with everything in the house.&#725; Wired connections: we have a home server, a NAS, an 'Ethernet over power lines' adapter and a very small Wi-Fi 802.11b router plugged into one of the 4 Ethernet ports.&#725; Shared storage: the Nighthawk comes with USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports (one of each). We attached USB-powered HDDs to each and found that they could be easily accessed by practically 'everything' (PCs, Android devices, Chromebooks). On my Windows 7 laptop, for example, I set them as both network drives and 'network locations' (no letter drive is needed) and I can also get to them through Chrome.&#725; QoS optimization: we rely on streaming heavily and the Nighthawk makes it very easy to optimize both downstream (Netflix, Amazon) flows and upstream (gaming).&#725; Auto update: just a nice thing to have and there's at least one major update coming up (see below)There are quite a few features that we didn't implement yet but might in the future:- Parental controls- Backup- Guest networks on either bands: just didn't get to these yet but they can be set in seconds if needed- USB-attached printer: may not do this because we are currently using both USB ports for HDDs and all our printers work well as wireless network devices.- DLNA server: this is one capability I was unable to test but I didn't spend a lot of time trying. I may call tech support. For some reason our PS3 does not see the router's shared drives. Not yet.And there are quite a few features that we may never set but it's good that they are there because I'm sure someone could use them. I doubt that I will ever allow 'over the internet' access to our router or to anything attached to it but one should never say never.COMING ATTRACTIONS (the future)Haven't mentioned it yet, but this IS an AC router. The 'ac' is a very new Wi-Fi protocol that significantly improves the Wi-Fi experience. AC-specific Explicit Beam Forming allows routers to identify the best path to reach a particular client and results in greater range and overall performance but an AC client is required for this to work. This is great but we don't have an 802.11ac device at this time.However,  the upcoming (mid October they say) firmware update will implement Implicit Beam Forming which works with 802.11n. The router will decide which of its 3 antennas (they should be positioned at different angles) is best to use with any particular client at any given time. Even better, another technology called Smart Connect will work with Implicit Beam Forming to pick the most efficient band (2.4GHz or 5GHz) for the best connection.OUR EXPERIENCESo far, the Nighthawk proved to be remarkably stable. There was no need for a one single forced reboot yet even though we did reboot it a few times as we kept setting or resetting features. It is relatively easy to operate even though some 'getting acquainted' time may benefit, especially if both versions of Genie are used.As I mentioned before, the significantly more powerful signal (when compared to our old Linksys) that comes out off the 3 antennas allowed us to retire the range extender and this eliminated certain issues we used to have due to the extender using the exact same SSID as the router.The router performs well under stress conditions. For example, just for the fun of it, I tried streaming some video at 1080p from the router's USB attached storage to my laptop where I played the MP4 file in Chrome and from there I 'cast' the content as 720p to a Chromecast device (the flow would be from the HDD to the router via USB 3.0, then wireless stream to my laptop at 1080p, then wireless stream from laptop to router at 720p, then resent by router to Chromecast at 720p). It went well, all while someone was on the phone (VoIP) and we also had some Roku streaming and online game playing. I am impressed.For a more 'everyday use' experience, my Chromebook plays Netflix at its at HD-quality while some 100 ft away, on the second floor (the router is in the basement). It's flawless, perfect and it couldn't be done by the Linksys EA4500 without hiccups, even when the range extender was on.RATINGFive stars are well deserved at this time and, it can only get better if the promised update adds the Beam Forming/Smart Connect capabilities. I will probably update my review once that happens.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[0, 0]",Alpha router,2013,10, 13,,7892,1369,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20131013

It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.What you get is what emerged as the standard, full-featured HDMI 1.4 cable. The HDMI consortium defined 4 main types of HDMI of which the ""High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet"" is the de-facto standard that everyone is selling because no one has much use for the lesser configurations. This allows everyone to call their wires 'High Speed' which is very much meaningless since practically all HDMI cables are 'high speed' these days. The 'Ultra' in this cable name means probably 'nothing', it's just branding.These being said, the price is right and you are getting a good, standard HDMI cable for you money. The one I've received behaved well.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 was adopted in 2009 and it's backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.HDMI 1.4 allows for the following features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetStandard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.","[0, 0]","Nice, standard HDMI wire",2013,11, 2,,4014,657,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20131102

(UN BEE LEE VUH BULL!!!!)BACKGROUND:I've used Roxio products for more years than I can remember and I've reviewed at least two prior Creator versions and my reviews were positive because I actually liked Creator. I attempted to install Roxio NXT 2 on a Windows 7 Enterprise machine with 8GB or RAM with Roxio NXT already installed.THE HORROR:The installation program detected Roxio NXT (older version) and warned that it was going to remove it prior to setting up NXT 2 which was fine with me. While the installation proceeded I watch with horror as it was removing not only Roxio NXT but also Corel WinDVD (never asked for permission to do so). Yes, it may be true that Corel owns Roxio but it's also true that I OWN MY COPY OF COREL WINDVD and Roxio or Corel are NOT allowed to remove things from MY computer unless I agree. And they never asked.Well... a few minutes later, the Setup program was claiming that it was now rolling back whatever it installed or removed (not WinDVD though) and told me that installation was 'interrupted'. Strange. There were no traces left of the previously installed WinDVD or Roxio NXT.I ran a registry cleanup tool, then rebooted my computer and re-tried Setup. Same error.I went to Roxio's NXT 2 help page seeking some Tech Support help but I was advised to look at the Knowledge Base first. There was an article advising that a 'safe boot' could allow for the installation to complete. I set my laptop to boot up in safe mode and this time installation failed almost immediately.I went back to the help page, hoping to talk to a tech support person. Amazingly, YOU DON'T GET SUPPORT from Roxio or Corel or whatever they are unless you either pay them more money or have a 'support code' valid for 14 days AFTER installation and registration. Of course, my copy could not install and could not be registered because it didn't install.I went back to the site and registered hoping to get the '14-day free support code'. Of course they wanted my email address and all kinds of other bits of info. Once registered I received a few Spam-loaded emails and finally, the support code. Well... not so fast. Can't speak to a human yet. I am now asked to write an email, explaining what my problem is. I pasted this review because I am not going to waste a lot more time. Let's see what happens next. My prediction: they are going to ask for copies of the dozens of logs that the SETUP program left behind - as this was the first time and the only time installation failed on anyone's computer.ADVICE:There are several issues with Roxio's product:- It appears to be badly coded or at least the SETUP module is.- The installation program seems to try to access highly restricted and highly protected features of the OS - the installation log showed Windows refusing to allow them unauthorized access and complaining that certain files had invalid signatures.- There is no tech support to speak of.- The sellers of Roxio seem to view their customers primarily as milkable cash cows.- The sellers of Roxio seem to believe that they actually own the software installed on your computer and can do with it as they please, including removing it.It's possible that not everybody is going to duplicate my experience but why take a chance when there are better and better supported products 'out there'?___________________________________________UPDATE: I received a couple of emails from tech support. The first one thanks me for reporting a problem and... ""Looking for faster support? The Premium Training and Support Plan offers you unlimited first-in-line priority phone support plus personalized training on any topic of your choice."" (see the 'milkable cash cow' thoughts above because we should pay to get something working after first we pay to purchase it, right?) The next email states that my 'detailed feedback' was being sent up the management channels.UPDATE 12/21/2013:An email arrived a couple of days later titled: ""Case 01959591 is Awaiting Additional Information"". I am ordered to log into Corel's site and provide the information Corel wants from me (of course, they don't bother to tell me what it is they are waiting for because it's so much better if the customer wastes some time finding their way through Corel's tech support maze). If I don't reply in 5 days (an ultimatum?) ""I will assume there has been resolution if I don't hear back from you within the next 5 days, at which point I will go ahead and close your case.""Well... not so fast. I log in at the site and this is what I get: ""The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource (Session timed out. Please use the back button, reload and try again.) Of course, I keep getting the same error no matter how many times I try so, this is it. So much for Corel's support. I'm wondering if those who pay get the same nice treatment.UPDATE 12/22/2013Tired of waiting, I decide to reinstall my old Creator NXT. It installs just fine but then nothing works, it keeps complaining about missing registry keys.I fully remove Creator NXT, clean the registry again (use Glary's tools) and try NXT 2 again but this time I do 'custom install' and select ONLY Creator NXT 2 (do not install NERO and ""Roxio Back on Track"". To my surprise, the install is successful but, of course, I now have a rather abbreviated version (many features missing) of my old Creator NXT. I give up on Corel's tech support.Oh, and one more thing. Ever since I attempted to install NXT 2 for the first time, my laptop no longer restarts on its own after a reboot. It's on but all I get is a blank screen. The only way I can bring it back to life is to remove the battery for a few seconds and then start again.

We've ordered a nice HP Chromebook 11 since and now, because someone in our household wanted a one that was 'bigger', we went for the '14'.WHY A CHROMEBOOK?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do better most of the time.&#725; Our Chromebooks are our most used computers excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.&#725; Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on the Chromebook, I can't see how one would ever be infected. I am now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.&#725; Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chromium wasn't cracked yet.&#725; Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.&#725; Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chromium every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence. HP's Chromebook will not replace Samsung's, it will be used by another family member who really, really wanted one after watching my happy relationship with our first one.&#725; Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy for a while once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates/upgrades process. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.&#725; The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.&#725; Chromium is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.&#725; Chromium being such a streamlined OS, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.&#725; Relatively low prince, 11.6"" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.HP's CHROMEBOOK 14 vs. Chromebook 11Having owned two other Chromebooks already, from the start, it was a very familiar feeling. HP's 14 is not 'exactly like' Samsung's and this big HP is quite different from HP's Chromebook 11 but it's easily recognizable as a Chromebook.Here are some changes:&#725; DISPLAY: HP 11's colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left/right or up/down. HP 14's is not as bright and the larger size doesn't come with better resolution.&#725; KEYBOARD. It's a draw. I like both keyboards as they have a good layout and nice travel. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both.&#725; DESIGN: HP 11's is more stylish design but they are both Okay as far as I can tell. HP 11 is nicer though.&#725; PORTS: This is where the HP 14 wins big time. It comes with USB 3.0 ports vs. HP 11's USB 2.0 and full HDMI.&#725; POWER: It's not too obvious but yes, the HP 14 is sometimes faster refreshing screens. Videos play equally smoothly on both.&#725; SIZE AND WEIGHT: HP 14 is a lot heavier so if you travel and size and weight matters then HP 11 is the right choice. If your Chromebook is mostly homebound and most of your computing and media playing takes place in a room shielded from direct or indirect sunlight then the HP 14 gives you the bigger display advantage.Overall I like HPs larger Chromebook. It has better ports options than the HP 11, it's faster and you get a bigger screen on a body that's not as light and pretty.RATINGI am not going to compare a 300 dollar HP Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. I noticed that many 'pro' reviewers are complaining because Chromebooks and this particular one are not 'high end' and aren't as nice as the Pixel and such. Well... did anyone check the prices? So, yes, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.HP's 14 is a four-star to me because it's at least as good and in some way better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted Samsung but I personally prefer the HP 11. As far as performance, they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast.Chromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets.","[369, 396]",The Bigger Brother,2013,11, 14,0.9318181818181818,6265,1103,Positive,369,396,27,0.033545025240188896,20131114

We've been using ours all throughout the charger 'crisis' and we are as happy with it today if not happier than we were on 'day one'. More than two months later, HP's Chromebook 11 continues to be a beautiful little device with a great display that continues to do most of what I require during my off-work hours. It traveled with me on my vacation and will travel with me again and it's there (on couch or on my bedside table) when I need it._____________________________________________________WHY A CHROMEBOOK?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do better most of the time.&#725; My Chromebook is my most used computer excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.&#725; Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on the Chromebook, I can't see how one would ever be infected. I am now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.&#725; Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chromium wasn't cracked yet.&#725; Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.&#725; Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chromium every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence. HP's Chromebook will not replace Samsung's, it will be used by another family member who really, really wanted one after watching my happy relationship with our first one.&#725; Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy for a while once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates/upgrades process. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.&#725; The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.&#725; Chromium is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.&#725; Chromium being such a streamlined OS, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.&#725; Relatively low prince, 11.6"" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.HP's CHROMEBOOK 11I haven't spent a lot of time with HP's but, from the start, it was a very familiar feeling. HPs is not 'exactly like' Samsung's but it's easily recognizable as a Chromebook.Here are some changes:&#725; USB-based charging. This is a BIG thing. The biggest negative in the case of Samsung's Chromebook was the proprietary charger. HP's USB-based charging allows the use of most off-the-shelf chargers so there's a lot less to worry.&#725; Better quality display. When compared to Samsung's the colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left/right or up/down.&#725; Nicer keyboard. It's the same layout but the keys seem to have a little more travel. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both but, on a blind test, I would probably pick HP's over Samsung's.&#725; Somewhat more stylish design. I got the black model and I like both the color and the color accents. Some prefer 'silver' but they are both Okay as far as I can tell.&#725; Fewer ports. There are no USB 3.0 or HDMI ports on the HP's even though my understanding is that you can, in fact output HDMI through the Micro USB. This may be a big deal for some and they should get Samsung's if that's the case. Speaking for myself, I never felt a need to output HDMI off my Chromebook, ever. Same for USB data transfers.Overall, I am very pleased with HPs device. The lack of USB 3.0 and HDMI ports amount to a big 'nothing' to me and their absence is balanced and surpassed by the non-proprietary charging method, much nicer display and better keyboard.RATINGI am not going to compare HP's Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. I noticed that many 'pro' reviewers are complaining because Chromebooks and this particular one are not 'high end' and aren't as nice as the Pixel and such. Well... did anyone check the prices? So, yes, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.HPs is a five-star to me because it's at least as good and in some way better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted Samsung. The thirty dollars price difference between the two can be justified by HP's supporting USB charging, its much nicer display and its marginally better keyboard. As far as performance, they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast (no need of an HDMI cable for that) - I mention it because I just tried that.Chromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets._____________________________________________________CHROMEBOOK vs. CHROMEBOOK (HPs vs.Acer C720I had the opportunity to play with Acer's Chromebook for a day and was therefore able to compare them side by side.- Advantage HP -&#725; Looks and design. HPs looks much better in my view, you have color choices and that's that.&#725; Display. Same size, same resolution but HPs display is brighter, sharper and, most importantly, can be viewed from almost any angle. Not the case with Acer's.&#725; Charging. The ability to charge HPs Chromebook through almost any USB charger is very important to me. Acer's charger is proprietary.- Advantage Acer -&#725; Horsepower. Acer's appears to be faster and it should be given its faster processor.&#725; Ports. You get HDMI out, USB 3.0 and SD card slot, all of them missing on HP's machine.&#725; Price. At least at launch, Acer's was selling for less.I would say it's a tie when it comes to the keyboard and track pad's feel.Acer's machine has the advantage if you are more 'productivity oriented' and need expansion capabilities (ports) and more raw CPU power. You would prefer the HP if you want a Chromebook mainly for fun and casual activities where looks, the availability of a charger and, very importantly, the quality of the display count more._____________________________________________________NOTES:- Like most Chromebooks, this one too comes with a free 100GB in Google's cloud for two years. I didn't take advantage of that offer and I'm not going to go for this one, simply because I have no use of 'cloud' storage that goes beyond Gmail at this time.- While Chromebooks are immune to viruses and other forms of malware, you are as tracked and 'monetized' while on a Chromebook as you are when browsing from your laptop or tablet or phone. However, there are ways to disrupt and confuse the trackers and my two favorite extensions these days are Disconnect Search (or Disconnect.me) that makes it impossible for Google to log your search activities and DoNotTrackMe which does what the name implies. Worth trying.","[531, 556]",Our Second Chromebook,2013,10, 14,0.9550359712230215,9090,1544,Positive,531,556,25,0.03888617489008305,20131014

The may reason I am happy is clearly 'price'.The TT850 does just about the better known brands do includi9ng TWO Slave modes and, as far as I can tell, and I am NOT a pro, it does it as well as the super-expensive counterparts. Yes, it's a little bulky and maybe not as flashy looking as, let's say, some of the Canon equivalents but you could buy three or four of NEEWER's for the amount you'd pay for Cannon's least expensive.SETUP AND OPERATIONThanks to the nice instruction manual, setup was almost as easy as taking out of the box and mounting it on the camera. Well... not THAT fast. The TT850 comes with its own rechargeable battery and it was fully charged so you still need to snap it in but, once that's done, it's ready for the your camera's hot shoe.Taking advantage of its feature is probably where the amateurs like me get separated from the pros but I'm taking it slowly and learning it bit by bit and all is good so far. The manual, while brief, it's very much to the point and all worked well. Here is what TT850 can do:- In MANUAL MODE it the flash mounted on the hot shoe, it fires whenever the camera's shutter is pressed. You will have to set the output level and the zoom level - see below- OUTPUT can be set from 1/128 of power to full power and values in between.- ZOOM sets the flash coverage and can be set to match the lens focal length from 24 mm to 105 mm.- In SLAVE 1 MODE, the flash placed to act as complementary lighting unit will fire in sync when the master flash fire by simply detecting the master flash's light.- In SLAVE 2 MODE works with a TTL master flash and ignores the single pre-flash from the master, firing only with the second master flash.- RPT MODE (strobe) allows you to set the frequency in number of flashes per secondOther modes not tested by me are available such as:- Hi-Speed Sync Triggering requires a separate hi-speed sync trigger- Wireless Control is also possible with a separate remote control that NEEWER sells- Sync Triggering can be accomplished by inserting a trigger plug into the unit's Sync Cord JackThe great thing about this product is that you very much get everything you need to get going more or less out of the box and 'more' if you consider the rechargeable battery pack:* Flash Unit* Li-Ion battery* Battery charger* Cable (CAN' USE IT in US). It comes with UK-style prongs so you'll need to find a replacement and most old monitor or computer power cables should do* Mini stand for use in slave modes* Protective case (very well done)* Manual (don't lose it)While not 'small', the flash fits nicely into a sufficiently large camera bag such us ourDolica SB-015RD Sling Backpack for DSLRwhich is great for as long as don't mind it being red. You can probably squeeze in the accessories as well but the battery should outlast more flash-shooting sessions so the charger can be left at home in my view.OVERALL EXPERIENCESuch an affordable should be ideal for most of us non-professionals. Speaking for myself, the TT850 is probably more I will ever want/need, at least for the foreseeable future as it works well with my camera and addresses all of my needs with some features to spare.I don't know if everybody gets the Brit-style electric cord but, since it comes with a pre-charged battery, you have a few days to find one or get yourself one.","[3, 4]",All of my needs with a few features to spare,2013,12, 22,0.75,3571,646,Positive,3,4,1,0.02247191011235955,20131222

We are very happy with all three and we're likely to purchase more so, let me start by answering the obvious question (see next paragraph).WHY A CHROMEBOOK?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3&#725; 4&#725; 5 times as much should do better most of the time.&#725; If counting 'hours' and excluding 'work hours', Chromebooks are our most used computers and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.&#725; Malware, spyware, adware&#725; free.

If you have a Google account you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment, including Chrome extensions, shortcuts and so forth.&#725; Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chromium every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than getting slower and slower and gradually falling into obsolescence.&#725; Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while they tend to get very busy for a few minutes or longer once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates/upgrades download and install. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place out in the clouds they don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.&#725; The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it also negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.&#725; Chromium is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.&#725; While you don't get the top of the line CPU on a $299 Chromebook, performance is much better than that same CPU on a traditional laptop because there's no need to constantly run virus scans, there is on disk fragmentation to deal with, among other things.&#725; No need to worry about backups and losing your data. Yes, keeping your important or very personal data in the cloud is not something that I do or I would advise anyone to do but 'everything else' should reside in the cloud just fine and the odds of that data ever being lost are quite small.&#725; Quite versatile. You can easily pair your Chromebook with Bluetooth (or dongled) mice, keyboards and speakers. And you can even use a remote desktop app to access a 'true' PC when you really need one. You can make phone calls and video calls and you can even play some games.&#725; Runs Ubuntu. I haven't tried it yet myself because... well... I have Ubuntu running on a PC already but if you Google Chromebook Ubuntu or Chromebook Linux you will get a few posts that explain exactly how it's done.&#725; Works offline too. Yes, it's not a laptop but there are apps that work well offline and if you don't trust Google's cloud you can access your own local NAS at least for viewing docs, PowerPoint slides or playing videos. There must be a way to save edited docs in your own cloud rather than Google's but I didn't spend much time trying to figure it out yet.&#725; Relatively low prince, 11.6"" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard&#725; core gaming even though you CAN do them, it's just that you can do them better on a PC or laptop or tablet.

Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use device and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one I most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'. Chromebooks, now that we have three of them around are what our kids prefer for their school&#725; related activity and most of their entertainment, when not playing games.ACER's C720pHaven't spent a lot of time with the 720p but, and not surprisingly so, it's all very familiar because this is our third Chromebook. The 720p is not 'exactly like' HPs or Samsung's but it's easily recognizable as a Chromebook and that's a good thing.There are many common features between our three Chromebooks but there are quite a few important differences so here's what it's probably worth to mention:&#725; Touch, of course. I didn't spend a lot of time with the much more expensive Pixel but the C720p does what I expected. It's not an iPad or a Nexus 7 when it comes to responsiveness but it's quite decent and it's good to have options.&#725; The LED 1366 x 768p HD display resolution is no different from the other Chromebooks and I would say it's somewhere in between HPs (better) and Samsung's. But the differences are minor.&#725; USB 3.0, USB 2.0 and HDMI ports plus the SD card slot make the C720p a relatively easy to connect device, especially when compared to HPs.&#725; Intel Celeron 2955U processor with (only) 2GB of DDR3 RAM makes it the fastest Chromebook. I suspect that a 4GB model is going to be available soon but even with 2GB it still feels fine.&#725; Decent speakers. Quite impressive, in fact for their size.&#725; Great keyboard, as far as the chicklets keyboards come. I prefer it to the others but keyboards can be such a personal thing. It's the typical Chromebook layout and the key travel is good. As a touch typist it took me little time to get used to it.&#725; Good battery life. They promise 7&#725; 8 hours. I don't know how realistic that may be but at 75% brightness ours ran for almost six ours after a full charge.&#725; Same freebies Google: 100GB in the clouds for 2 years being the most attractive.RATINGI am not going to compare Acer's Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. I noticed that many 'pro' reviewers are complaining because the 200&#725; 300 dollar Chromebooks are not 'high end' and aren't as nice as the Pixel and such. Well... did anyone check the prices? So, yes, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one may prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.Acer's device is at least as good and in some way better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted Samsung and, while not as pretty, it seems to be speedier and definitely much better connected than HPs. The price difference can be justified by the touch capability which is nice to know it's there.Chromebooks and the C720p are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as a revolutionary device as tablets.","[400, 415]",Chromebook the Third,2013,12, 4,0.963855421686747,7950,1401,Positive,400,415,15,0.034945448624002604,20131204

Following the 5 minutes or so setup, preceded by maybe another 5-10 minutes of browsing through the manual, my only other EX6100 activity was to plug it into a wall outlet and leave it there. The end.The manual documents two setup paths. Connecting with WPS is probably the easier method if your router has a physical WPS button. Our Netgear Nighthawk R7000 has a 'soft' WPS setup so I decided to use the 'Netgear Genie Smart Setup' path which is almost equally easy. It involves connecting to one of the default Extender's WiFi networks then simply follow the Wizard prompts and specify whether you want a dual-band extender or 2.4G only, name your extender networks, enter your router's networks SSIDs and not much else. By default, the extender will use the existing networks security settings and their passphrases. Once plugged into its permanent location, the EX6100 required no further attention.On the client's side, you are going to see one or two (if you have a dual band router) additional networks and you connect to them in the same way you do to any other WiFi network. On fixed devices you will probably decide whether you want the original or an extended network as your more or less permanent connection, depending on signal strength. On mobile devices, you may want to switch between networks as you move around the house.As far as signal strength and performance, I used to get about 2-3 bars in the upstairs bedroom that's farthest away from the basement-located router at the other end of the house. With the extender placed on the ground floor, close to the 'center' of the house, I am getting a constant 4 bars on the extended network. I didn't notice any delays or hiccups.The EX6100 can also be set as an access point. I assume this mode is equally reliable and easy to set up but I didn't have a chance to test it yet.The short and to the point manual is well written and it clearly explains the setup process and settings options, provides physical placement advice and has a good FAQ section.I am rating the EX6100 a 5 stars because it was easy to set and it performed flawlessly ever since.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[2, 3]","So good, I almost forgot it existed",2014,04, 11,0.6666666666666666,2372,415,Positive,2,3,1,0.022439342126689465,20140411

It has the ability to control everything physically connected to it and it seamlessly reaches out to other devices on our home network and beyond, to the Internet. The temptation to go over every single feature I am aware of is strong but receivers have become complex, multi-featured machines and there's a comprehensive manual that does that. I will therefore talk about what my testing revealed and what I found impressive or not so much, useful or less so, feature-rich or overwhelmingly complex or complicated. This could mean that I may not speculate about features that some may find worth discussing at some length and accept it as inevitable but I wasn't able to test hands-on. My hope is that the setup I used for my test drive is not unlike what most typical users are likely to have.The receiver was tested as a 7.2 surround system. I did not set a second zone. Directly attached to it via HDMI were a TV, a satellite box, a WD media hub, a Blu-ray/DVD player and a gaming console with the last three having their own Ethernet connections. A security camera system was attached through a component video cable. The receiver was connected to the Internet via a Ethernet cable which in turn talks to a router over the power lines. The receiver and everything hard-wired to it were set to be operated with a Harmony universal remote control.FIRST IMPRESSIONSRight out of the box, Onkyo's receiver is not unlike the one (by Sony) used for the past 4 years and it's very much like the HT-RC460 which is the receiver I'm using as my permanent hub:- 7.2 surround- 2 zones- supports nearly all types of I/O: composite video and analog audio, coax, optical, HDMI (more ports with 8 in, 2 out, the higher v1.4), AM and FM antennae.- numerous sound processing modes with some new ones such as Dolby Pro Logic IIz and DTS Neo:6 decoding- video resolution beyond 1080p to cover 3D and 4K (the resolution used in movie theaters)And if the above appear to be only minor enhancements or features (4K video?) that no one is likely to need 'today', here are some brand new capabilities that should easily justify upgrading from an older model.- Ethernet- DLNA- Overlaid on-screen menusWhether the above are significant upgrades it depends on each individual's needs. I will discuss them below and explain why they matter to me. What follows is my experience with the product during my week-long test drive.PACKAGING AND CONTENTSBesides the receiver's body I found a CD that holds the manual as a .pdf file, the remote control and its 2 AA batteries, the AM/FM antennae and the special-purpose mic with a very long wire used to calibrate the speakers. This receiver does not come bundled with speakers or speaker wires or any other accessories.The contents are well protected inside the box and I know that they are so because UPS subjected the package to some extremely rough treatment and yet everything inside turned out to be Okay.INSTALLATIONNo, it wasn't easy and it took q while to get things going but Onkyo providing a set of sticky, color-coded labels for the speaker wires helped a lot my connecting a set of existing speakers to the new receiver.Some of the HDMI inputs are pre-labeled as Cable/Satellite, Game, DVD, Computer and that made setting the HDMI connections easier and easier to document.Once the wiring is done the receiver can automatically calibrate the speakers using the supplied, special-purpose calibration mic. A full auto-calibration round completes in less than 10 minutes.If the box was connected to the network it's likely through the Ethernet wire it will suggest a firmware update. After that... there are many paths.You may complete the setup using the provided remote control and the receiver's own display or you may take advantage of the on-screen menus feature which is a lot more efficient. The on-screen menus make it easy to integrate the receiver into an universal remote control. I am currently using it with a Harmony 900. Alternatively, I can use an Android tablet with the Onkyo remote app installed and I do use it, especially when I play content off the Internet or other devices on my home network but more about that later.My setup didn't take advantage of some of the more advanced features that HDMI 1.4 implements such us the Ethernet channel that would allow the receiver to share its Internet link with other connected devices such as network-capable TVs, Blu-ray or media hubs or the audio return channel that can send the audio signal from a playback device such as the TV back to the receiver.OPERATIONThe word of the day is 'flexibility', or you can be as sophisticated as you care or dare or you can let the receiver do what it thinks it's best for you and probably get 95% of what you would if you spent hours tweaking and trying out settings individually. The manual enumerates everything, feature by feature and there are many features, some very useful, quite a few such us image adjustments, redundant. The other word of the day is comprehensiveness.When it comes to audio, Onkyo's receiver supports just about any standard in existence and it will do its best to provide you with the optimal output. You can set it all to 'auto' or you can tell it what to do whether you are listening to music, playing a game or watching a movie. You can tweak with individual speakers. Same for video. You can play with individual settings all you want and if the end-result doesn't look nearly as good as the defaults you can quickly revert back to the default settings and then try it again.I'm using a Harmony and I didn't use it myself extensively but the remote control has the capability to control everything at the entertainment hub. The manual explains how to do it and has hundreds of codes for the various brands and models.FEATURESLike for most receivers, dealing with HD TVs, cable or satellite boxes, Blu-ray players and gaming devices is 'base business', especially when they are connected through HDMI. Onkyo's receiver does it well and so do most other receivers. But this is not all that Onkyo does.But then you connect the to your home network and a world of new possibilities opens up.While AM and FM radio are still supported, Onkyo's receiver can and will get your local Internet-broadcasting stations. The vTuner service will get you that but you can also play any station in the world and you can search by location (continent/country/city), genre (available inside each country as well), popularity and so forth. I had no idea until a couple of days ago that my favorite Electronica radio was broadcasting from Romania.But that's not all. Besides radio stations, the TX supports a number of services, including my favorite, Pandora which comes loud and clear and so far commercials-free. Other services include SiriusXm, Slacker, AUPEO!, last.fm, Spotify, MP3tunes, Rhapsody and I suspect that additional ones may be added through future firmware upgrades.And there are more features. You can play iPhone content via the dedicated port easily accessible on the front.I suspect that there are many other features I didn't notice or I didn't find to be interesting enough to mention here but someone else would view as very important but I'm going to stop because there's the big .pdf manual that discusses almost everything.PROS AND CONSThe big pros for this receiver are, in my view:- Seamless network/Internet integration that unlock so many interesting features and capabilities- On-screen (and it can be TV or phone or tablet screen) menus which overlay over the existing video display.- Extreme flexibility in configuration from the 'let Onkyo figure it out for me' level to very detailed tweaking.As for cons. Well... the manual is not the most user-friendly in the world but I can live with that. The Android remote control app while great and very easy to use needs an urgent update because the 'phone' resolution does not scale well on a 10-inch tablet and it seems to prevent the Android device from going to sleep even when the app is not in the foreground. Also, the warranty is a little too restrictive and appears to discourage on-line purchases - see below.MY RATINGWarranty-related issues aside, I am very pleased with this receiver. It does everything I expect from a receiver and then it does more and better. In other words, it exceeded my expectations which qualifies it for a 5 stars with flying colors rating._________________________________________________WARRANTY AND SUPPORTI did not weigh in warranty and service when I rated the receiver as a 5 star. Depending on where you buy your receiver from a brick and mortar dealer or online, you may be very happy with Onkyo's warranty or less so.The receiver's warranty is for 2 years, parts and labor which is a good thing. There are lots of exclusions, nothing unusual, ranging from you altering the product, it being damaged by things connected to it or you using it for commercial purposes. If you bought this online or you are planning to do so, consider the following:- Save your receipt AND the original box because you are going to need them both if you are to ship the receiver for warranty repairs.- Onkyo's warranty only covers units purchased from an authorized dealer. Onkyo considers Amazon to be authorized dealer but... don't forget: receipt, box.- My understanding is that you will be paying for shipping the receiver to Onkyo but they will be covering shipping when returning the box back to you.- There are no quick replacement/cross-shipping provisions so be prepared to do without if your receiver breaks down and needs repair.- If, after reading the above you are concerned about warranty service you should consider purchasing your receiver from a 'brick and mortar' authorized dealer because then all you need to do is take the box back to the dealer and you won't have to worry about paying for shipping and keeping the original box.Onkyo made a great receiver but they should consider improving their support for online purchases because other sellers of electronic devices do much better. When a monitor and a rather large laptop I purchased online broke both makers sent me a box and a pre-paid shipping label. I understand why the makers of complex devices would rather have us buy from dealers, because they don't need to worry about direct user support, but online purchases are a reality and other makers of electronics provide much better/friendlier support to their online customers.","[23, 29]","Well-rounded, feature rich receiver",2014,01, 23,0.7931034482758621,10564,1785,Positive,23,29,6,0.022960429897410845,20140123

I can easily shoot videos while holding it in one hand and its form plus the ability to orient the viewing screen to some degree does make shooting comfortable for as long as I am not outside on a bright, sunny day which would make it hard to view the screen and whatever parameters and status messages may be displayed on it. The image stabilization feature makes hand-holding the 'mini X' practical.Image quality is a tradeoff involving the amount of storage you can afford on the SD card (not included). You can pick anything from 'better than HD' or 17 Mb/s to 'YouTube' quality or lower. Interestingly and quite useful, the cam can in fact create lower quality copies of a high quality video and store them on your memory card and it does it quite quickly, saving you the time and trouble of firing up some other piece of software on your PC. I was pleased with the overall picture and sound quality.The camcorder is easy to use, in the sense that you can shoot pretty good video without having to dig through the numerous options provided but there are limitations, the most visible being the lack of a zoom. You can flip between a 'normal' angle and a 'fish eye' wide angle but there's nothing in-between. Of course, there are options, including a Macro capability and even a modest zoom would have made this a more desirable and useful product.I am generally pleased with the 'mini X' and I would say that it meets and even exceeds expectations for a product in this price range. It should do a great job, especially when shooting indoors with the 'mini X' attached to a tripod and it should be reasonably good outdoors again, if you have the ability to place it in one fix spot.P.S. - for what it's worth, I actually posted 2 videos at Amazon, shot with the 'mini X'. The quality has been lowered to about 3 Mb/s but this should give you some idea of what you can get out of it in terms of picture and sound.

It comes with a nicely designed flip-out antenna that should help with its signal boost function when used as a range extender and it's an easy to set and operate device, considering the several possible configurations.AT HOMEWhen set as a range extender, which is the most likely configuration when used at home, the Trek game me an extra bar on the second floor room farthest away from our basement main router.In a small home or apartment, the Trek could be set to be THE router, wired to your ISP's device (cable modem) and allowing one additional wired connection plus Wi-Fi for the rest of the house.Also, it can work as a bridge to a device that's far from the main router and does not support Wi-Fi in which case the Trek will be placed next to that device which would have a wired connection to the Trek.OUTSIDEOne possible use would be to offer some protection when connected to a public hotspot but having the Trek connect to the hotspot while your computer/phone/tablet connect to the Trek.Can also have it set as your personal router/firewall when in a hotel room.OPERATIONEvery single configuration that I tried worked flawlessly.

I do like this Toshiba but I am going to return it because, while it comes with many features that would theoretically make it 'better' than my favorite HP Chromebook 11 or our cracked Samsung or our still healthy Acer, it's lacking in a few that in my view - and this is my view only - make a Chromebook a Chromebook and make Chromebooks such great devices.TOSHIBA vs. OUR OTHER CHROMEBOOKS (especially the HP)As I noted above, I am now returning Toshiba's Chromebook but, for anyone who's shopping for one, please read why because some of its features that don't mean much to me may turn out to make good reasons for someone else to pick this model over whatever else.Toshiba's entry comes with a number of improvements over HP's Chromebook 11 and it distinguishes itself from Acer's C720P Chromebook by its larger display. If we are going to do an HP vs. Toshiba's comparison, this is where Toshiba comes ahead:- Faster processor - Toshiba's is without a doubt significantly speedier than HP's Chromebook 11 thanks to its Haswell processor. Tabs open and update faster. The 11 Acer C720P is also Haswell-based.- Longer battery life - I have to admit, while my HP will easily play a 2-hour movie off Netflix, the battery would be more than half-drained in the process. I was able to play two movies on the Toshiba and there was still enough life for a couple of hours of Web surfing.- More, better ports - Toshiba's 2 USB 3.0 ports beat HP's slower 2 USB 2.0, then there's a full HDMI and a memory card reader slot on the Toshiba while all HP has is a nice but not as capable SlimPort output.- Larger display - 13 inches is larger than 11 inches.- Fingerprint-proof body - unlike HP's smooth, slick body, Toshiba's grooved body finish is not only fingerprint-proof but also allows for a better grip.However, fast CPUs, physical expansion ports and a 13-inch display are not why I am in love with Chromebooks - I do appreciate the long battery life though. I happen to prefer a Chromebook such as HPs or Acer's for a number of reasons and here is why I prefer HP's beautiful 11 inch product over Toshiba's.- Toshiba's is heavy -  it's exactly one pound or almost 50% heavier than HP's Chromebook. I happen to use my Chromebook on my lap, on the couch, in bed or to carry it around the house held in one hand and one pound makes a big difference. Watching a movie in bed or checking the weather in the morning as I wake up or browsing through the news while I was watching a movie on the big living room TV was awkward with the Toshiba. Because it's... heavy.- Toshiba is larger, thicker - 11 inches vs 13 inches may not seem like such a big difference but the 11-inch form factor may be the sweet spot when it comes to size of little computer gadgets. Something larger becomes more difficult to carry around the house or at least that's my experience.- Proprietary charger - I can use most USB chargers with my HP's Chromebook but Toshiba's comes with its own. Yes, Toshiba's longer battery life makes it less likely that it needs a charge while in the middle of doing something but the ability to charge your Chromebook even when the original charger was misplaced or stopped working is a major convenience.- HP's has a stronger body - and it's not a subjective impression entirely. HPs Magnesium chassis makes a well put together, solid little computer. Toshiba's larger, heavier body by comparison appears to be more fragile and less durable.- HPs display is vastly superior. It's not just brighter with more lively colors but it's also viewable from a much wider angle - practically from almost any angle. By comparison, Toshiba's display is dull. Add to the superior HP display the fact that Toshiba's has the exact same resolution as HP's Chromebook but the pixels are spread on a large display and you therefore get fewer 'dots per inch' on Toshiba's machine and that's not good.- HPs speakers sound better - yes, it's almost a subjective comment but everyone who listened to both agreed with me so maybe it's not too subjective.And then there are some of the subjective criteria. The HP is a very, very pretty little computer, I will even go as far as calling it 'beautiful'. I know, 'design' is subjective but once you've experienced such a slick Chromebook as HP's you may not be happy with one of the more 'industrial' designs. I prefer HPs design and finish, its responsive keyboard and trackpad to Toshiba's. Toshiba's body feels 'cheap' and rings hollow whenever I hit the keys or I hit (click) on the pad. It's as if the body has thin, not so sturdy walls that buckle a little when pressed.If the above sounds almost like an indictment on Toshiba's product, don't read it that way. I am still rating it as a 4 stars (I like it) because, while not the ideal Chromebook for me, this is still a Chromebook and that's a good thing. Get the Toshiba if speed, battery life, ports, and a larger display are what matters to you.For anyone not a Chromebook user yet, I am adding a couple of sections on what Chromebooks are and what they are good for. Whatever follows may not be very interesting to anyone who's already used one._____________________________________________________WHY A CHROMEBOOK?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do better most of the time.&#725; My Chromebook is my most used computer excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.&#725; Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on the Chromebook, I can't see how one would ever be infected. I am now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.&#725; Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chrome OS wasn't cracked yet.&#725; Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.&#725; Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chrome OS every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence. HP's Chromebook will not replace Samsung's, it will be used by another family member who really, really wanted one after watching my happy relationship with our first one.&#725; Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy for a while once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates/upgrades process. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.&#725; The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.&#725; Chrome OS is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.&#725; Chrome OS being such a streamlined OS, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.&#725; Relatively low prince, 11.6"" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.&#725; Chromebooks come with a free 100GB in Google's cloud for two years these days. Cloud storage is entirely optional and I wouldn't use it for anything sensitive but it's a good way to share and store data that's not important or confidential in nature.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","[46, 54]",Toshiba vs. our other Chromebooks - I like it but I'm returning it,2014,02, 17,0.8518518518518519,8852,1541,Positive,46,54,8,0.023644357596482656,20140217

The sound is great and it better be at this price but the SoundLink is not built on the Bose Wave technology and therefore do not expect simulated home theater quality sound to fill up your room. This is meant to be a portable device.Now, discussing the SoundLink while in a brand-blind mode, I happen to like its clear and reasonably loud output, the long battery life and its pairing easily with just about everything Bluetooth out there. Setup is easy and playback makes me into a happy listener. Can't get much better for a portable speaker.On the 'not so impressive' side of the evaluation coin, the SoundLink is more heavy than I expected for something that's meant to be portable, the narrow base makes it likely that it's going to fall on its back or on its face from time to time and I hope that one didn't have to pay extra to buy a cover which may be needed if you really, really want to take your speaker out on a trip and want some protection for those times when it falls on its back or on its face.In the end, it's the sound that matters most and the sound is good, almost too good for something 'outdoors'. The SoundLink covers the entire range from bass to acutes well and I couldn't detect much distortion unless the volume was all the way up. As good as the sound is, there's very little stereo separation which is Okay for something meant to be portable but worth considering nevertheless. The SoundLink should be a good pick if price was not a factor.","[4, 6]",Heavy Metal and falls... on its face,2014,03, 9,0.6666666666666666,1677,305,Positive,4,6,2,0.02247191011235955,20140309

To at least reduce it, because I want my reviews to be as bias-free as possible, I forced myself to use this Asus for at least one hour each day for the past several weeks. It wasn't easy and, after all these weeks, I am still a Chromebook user and, nothing personal, I will prefer a good 11"" Chromebook to a Windows 8 of the same size, touch-enabled or not, very much every time. I will explain why.PHYSICALI remember reading someone's remarks on how laptops are expected to 'travel around the world'. I do know a few world travelers but my experience is that most people do not travel around the world very often and my view is that the 11-inch form factor is meant to 'travel around the house' or fit into a backpack pocket and travel to school or to a friend's house. To that extent, each ounce counts because I want to be able to grab my little computer with one hand and move it around easily. When compared to my favorite HP Chromebook, the Asus machine feels heavy and significantly so. The Asus is also a lot thicker and it's a lot more difficult to open it, generally requiring two hands. The HP, on the other hand, is much thinner and feels light as a feather. It opens and closes easily and turns itself on once opened, with no need of more buttons pushing.I can see why, being heavier, the Asus benefits from a rougher, grooved skin because you need a better grip. However, the grooved finish is likely to make it harder to clean and I wasn't able to wipe out fingerprints with a microfiber cloth the way I do it on the HP.The Asus comes with its dedicated charger and it works well. Only the HP Chromebook, while charging faster through its own, can also use very much any phone/tablet charging device to at least keep in going and usually to slowly charge it in an emergency.PERFORMANCE AND SPECSThe Asus has better specs, on paper. The CPU is faster, has more memory, has its own hard disk and a large number of ports: 3 USBs, HDMI, card reader, VGA, Ethernet. But... wait... no Bluetooth, which probably explains the large number of physical ports. And the 802.11 Wi-Fi appears to be limited to 2.4GHz b/g/n and to not work in the 5GHz band. I prefer the HP Chromebook's elegant Bluetooth solution for connecting to various peripherals. Yes, it has fewer ports but, I must confess, except for sometimes using a USB dongle required by a mouse, I never felt a need for a physical port on it. Streamers such as Chromecast and Roku and various online services and 'the cloud' have very much eliminated the need for a physical HDMI port and I wouldn't want to see lots wires or any wires coming in and out of my little 11-inch gadget anyway.The Asus and the HP have similar screen resolutions supported but the Asus has 4GB of RAM, twice as much compared to the HP and it needs it because a computer needs a lot of RAM to support the ultra-heavy Windows 8 OS. Same for CPU speed. The Asus CPU is faster if we are to count cycles but it appears actually slower when in use due to the enormous Windows overhead.The built-in HDD, present in the Asus but not in a Chromebook, while of some (diminishing) utility, adds weight to the Asus machine and makes it run warmer that I prefer - I'm already used to the Chromebooks running silent and cool to notice even the low hum that the Asus HDD makes while churning through the Windows overhead 'stuff' and perhaps constantly checking for malware and file corruption.INTERFACEI actually love Windows 7. I also love the Chrome browser interface I get with Chrome OS. I can't stand Windows 8. It's bloated to the extreme, it's unnecessarily complicated and it appears to be more concerned with enabling Microsoft to suck in all the information it can from you, presumably to sell it to advertisers and who knows who else (ohh.. NSA, I forgot) and to promote its 'properties': Skype, Bing, Internet Explorer... I am not saying that Windows 8 can't be 'easy to use'. Yes, it can if you don't mind Microsoft telling you what's 'good for you' and doing exactly as told. If you want to deviate or customize a little... yes you can but, in my case, I ended up with a Chromebook-like interface, only a lot slower and harder to get to running on a hotter, heavier, noisier little computer.The Windows 8's inherent complexity gets even more annoying with this version's support for touch. It's 'neither here nor there'. The screen touch is poorly and unintuitively implemented in my view and my feeling was that I ended up with a dirty screen for no good reason. I believe 'touch' was an afterthought or a rush in Windows 8 and it shows. For example, when I click the touchpad on the login screen, a unneeded on-screen keyboard is displayed as if Windows doesn't know that it's running on a laptop with a permanently attached keyboard.WHY THIS ASUS?I am not sure if I wanted this as my everyday little laptop under any circumstance. Unless I felt that it was my duty to supply Microsoft and its business partners with loads of my personal data while sacrificing some convenience in the process. I use my 11-inch little computers for casual, in-house activities: watching movies in bed, reading the news while having breakfast, checking my emails, looking up things on Google or the Wikipedia, making quick phone calls, casting some Youtube videos to the big screen TV. All of the above are performed beautifully and easily by the lighter, thinner, cooler, easier to use, prettier and less expensive HP Chromebook. And I don't need to worry about viruses and constant and lengthy patches on it, disk crashes and file corruption or more bloatware stacking on top of pre-installed bloatware slowing everything down to a crawl. Yes, the Asus has a HDD and its sides are poked with various ports but I never felt the need of an HDD for my Chromebook and, the fewer ports that I almost never use the better. Yes, some laptops can and should be used for both 'home and office'. They tend to be significantly more powerful and can be used with add-ons such as 'docking stations' to allow for large screen, mice, full-size keyboards and other peripherals. This Asus should not be imagined as a home/office device.To conclude, this little computer is not 'for me'. I simply can't imagine myself connecting peripherals to a toy-like device made of home use through three (?), doing a wired Ethernet connection or attaching a thick HDMI cable to it. And I don't understand that lack of Bluetooth and its not supporting the 5GHz band for Wi-Fi when even $50 streamers do these days. My Chromebook bias and general dislike of Windows 8 noted, I simply don't like this machine. The ASUS has nice specs that maybe could be put to good use if Windows was replaced with some less bloated OS but, as is, I couldn't justify buying this machine. The ""don't like it"" should normally translate into a 2-star rating but I'm going to rate it as a 3-star, mostly because of the excellent display.","[61, 80]",Windows 8 Netbook vs. Chrome OS Chromebook,2014,04, 6,0.7625,7146,1275,Neutral,61,80,19,0.023774629539163004,20140406

It can memorize FM stations when in FM mode and will pause or skip to the next song or go to a specifically numbered track when playing off a USB device or memory card.Seiki's little bar is not the embodiment of sound perfection but I feel that the Seiki packs sufficient functionality and therefore value to make it worth the purchase price.

I will update my review as I learn and experience more if needed but I don't believe I've missed a lot because, as a current Roku 3 and Roku LT and Google Chromecast user, this is an easy to write review.BROAD ASSESSMENTThere are several Roku models out there and then there's Chromecast so one good question that needs to be answered is ""why a Roku Stick and not a Roku 3?"" or ""why a Roku and not a Chromecast?"" or ""why not a Chromecast rather than a Roku?"" As an owner and user of Roku LT, Roku 3 and now a Roku Stick and also a Chromecast, I will try to briefly provide some answers below but, first, let me state what the Stick is about and what it can and can't do.[Roku Stick vs. Roku 3]The Stick does very much everything a Roku 3 does, except that there are no games on it and it doesn't come with headphones. I confess that I never cared about playing games on the Roku because just about anything from a cheap phone to a gaming console beats the Roku gaming experience and I don't care about the headphone attachment either so not having these and paying less for your Roku is a good compromise but anyone who wants Roku games and a mono earbud should order a Roku 3.The Stick lets you access the same enormous amount of channels as the other Roku devices, mostly VOD (video on demand) but also live streams. Almost all the popular 'pay' channels (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu Plus, HBO Go, MLB.TV , PBS, Showtime...) are there and hundreds of streams you never heard of but may end up watching every once in a while. The on-screen channel store breaks it all down into categories and you can easily browse Roku's store on a computer or tablet and order your channels to your device. And if there's something that you can't find in the official store you can always check the private channel listings. When it comes to 'content' Roku 3 and the Stick should be almost indistinguishable.The Stick can pair with Roku's free mobile app to browse and select channels to stream and it should allow for cross-media searches so, for example, you can see where on the (major) channels/services a show or movie may be available and at what price.The Stick features the same 1080p resolution as Roku 3 but browsing through menus appears to be slower than on the Roku 3, more like what you get out of a Roku 2 or a Roku LT. Wi-Fi is as good as on previous models, easy to set and so far stable.And, of course, the Stick costs only half as much as the Roku 3.[Roku Stick vs. Chromecast]As I stated, we have a couple of Rokus around the house and a Chromecast attached to the big TV in the living room. I still like the Chromecast, especially its ability to cast my Windows computer screen but after I temporarily replaced it with the Roku Stick I am inclined to keep it this way, at least for a while and this is why.+ Remote control (Roku): Yes, controlling the Chromecast from a Chromebook or laptop or tablet or phone is fun but the remote is easier and I don't need to mess with my other gadgets. Yes, it's one additional remote and it's not likely it can be easily integrated into a universal remote but it happens to be what I prefer.+ Channels selection: this is were Roku's strength lies overall and it's 'hundreds' or 'over a thousand' for Roku vs. about a dozen (but growing) for Chromecast. Notably, Chromecast does not have an Amazon app and, given the Google/Amazon rivalry, it's not likely to have one soon but Roku does.= Screen casting works well with YouTube and Netflix and it's the same quality as what you get out of the Chromecast. Both Roku and Chromecast are likey to add more apps.- Casting off a browser is what may cause some to pick the Chromecast over a Roku. Yes, it only works with Chrome at this time (on Windows or a Chromebook) and the quality is very much affected by your computer's CPU and your Wi-Fi network but it does give you a lot of flexibility, especially with live streams.- Chromecast is less expensive.MY EXPERIENCEIf you've never used a Roku before but decided that you wanted one the Stick is probably the best bet because it's the least expensive Roku now unless you can get an LT on sale.Installation was as easy as attaching the Stick into your TV's HDMI port. Like the Chromecast, the Stick works with a power adapter that needs a wall outlet. Since I already had a Roku account, I used my existing credentials but for those who don't it's easy to create one but you will be asked for credit card info. Then... go to the channel store and order whatever you want from there. For pay services such as Netflix or Amazon you will have to go through additional steps involving separate authentication and access codes but it's pretty self-explanatory and it's only done once.The streaming is exceptionally smooth. I first set the Stick on the second floor which is some 60-70 ft. and two floors away from our dual-band Wi-Fi router located in the basement. Worked perfectly.Remote control operation is generally smooth and the interface is intuitive. I am very familiar with the Roku interface so this is no surprise for me but I found it intuitive even on 'day one' albeit I was using it with a different Roku model then.So far, the Stick was as stable and reliable as our Roku 3. There were no crashes and I didn't have to revisit my Wi-Fi setup after the initial installation. Will update once this changes.The 'universal search' feature I like very much. You simply type in the name of a movie or show even an actor and you will see all your options on all channels and you will know in advance whether it's going to be free or exactly how much it was going to cost. On the Roku 3 all information appears almost instantly._______________________________________________________________THE FAQI will try to keep this section as objective (factual) as possible. Some of the topics concern Roku in general, not specifically the Stick.Q: Why would I want a Roku?A: Roku has, by far, the largest number of 'channels' vs. any other competing product. If you like exploring content beyond the popular services (Netflix, Amazon, etc.) you should consider a Roku?Q: Why would I want a Roku Stick?A: The Stick is the least expensive Roku at this time. It's also the smallest and therefore inherently portable.Q: When I shouldn't pick a Roku Stick over other Roku models?A: The Stick is HDMI only, does not support games and does not come with the earbud attachment. It's also somewhat slower when compared to Roku 3.Q: Can I use a Roku Stick with a TV lacking an HDMI port?A: No.Q: What are the best screen resolution and audio supported?A: 1080p, 7.1/5.1 surround sound.Q: Is the Roku Stick energy efficient?A: The Stick can be powered through the provided AC adapter or your TV's (powered) USB port. Note that there is no on/off switch or button on the remote so it's always 'on' unless you unplug it.Q: Is there an Ethernet (wired) port?A: No. The Stick supports Wi-Fi connections only.Q: Is everything included to make my Roku Stick work besides a TV and an Internet router?A: Yes. You get the remote (batteries included), the AC wall adapter, the Get Started pamphlet.Q: Do I need 'line of sight' to control the Stick?A: No, it comes with an RF remote so you can operate it with the remote even if it's sitting at the back of your TV.Q: Can I stream off a PC?A: Yes through a supported service such as Plex (I know there are others but Plex is the only one I've tried so far).Q: Are the Roku channels free?A: Many of them are but Roku also streams 'premium' channels for which you will require a separate subscription.Q: What are private channels.A: These are channels that, for whatever reason, are not listed by the channel store. You can easily make them 'appear' on your TV by picking them from one of the sites that lists such channels. See the first comment to this review for the URLs of such sites.Q: How much it costs to use a Roku?A: Once purchased, it could cost you nothing. Or you may subscribe to one or more premium services.Q: Can I have more than one Roku tied to one account?A: Yes.Q: Will the Stick get the channels I set on my other Roku devices if I am using the same account?A: Yes.Q: Can I search for a specific movie or show across all of Roku's channel?A: Yes. You can also search for other related information such as movies featuring one specific actor. Only keep in mind that the not all services may show up in searches but all major or popular ones usually do.Q: Can I watch YouTube on the Roku?A: Yes.Q: Are there shortcuts to my favorite channels?A: The remote has dedicated buttons to MGo, Amazon, Netflix and Blockbuster.Q: If I also have Chromecast, will I be able to control which device gets the Youtube stream?A: Yes, tested on a Chromebook.Q: Can I cast from a phone or tablet?A: Yes for Netflix and Youtube at this time but more services should be added later.Q: Can I get live news channels on the Roku?A: Yes. You may be able to find such channels at the store or as private channels listings but most US 'mainstream' news channels only offer a selection of recent on-demand videos.Q: Are non-video streams supported?A: Yes, radio stations and music streaming channels such as Pandora are supported.","[1411, 1429]",Roku Strikes Back,2014,03, 27,0.9874037788663401,9233,1659,Positive,1411,1429,18,0.0677739781794496,20140327

Other than that, Inateck's matches Amazon's almost feature for feature:- Magnet keeps it closed.- Built-in sensor will turn the Kindle on whenever you open the cover.- Textured surface guarantees a good grip when holding it.- Front cover folds back for one-hand reading but it's not as flexible and pliant as Amazon's.Considering that Inateck's currently sells for less than half the price Amazon charges for their premium, ultra-deluxe cover, it's not a bad alternative. Truth be told, as much as Inateck's emulates Amazon cover's design, you will know and feel that your cover is a cheaper version of Amazon's original, especially when attempting to fold back the front cover as it constantly fights you, trying to revert to something close to an 'open book like' position which is not good. On the other hand, it's as light and protective as Amazon's.____________________________________________NOTE: At the time I posted the review, Inateck cover's price was listed at less than half of Amazon's. However, I see that its price fluctuates and it could go up as high as to match Amazon's so I want to make it clear: Amazon's cover would be my favorite by far if both items were offered at the same price.","[0, 0]",Copycat is more affordable (or not),2014,05, 27,,1676,270,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20140527

However, I found no fault whatsoever to this adapter.If you need a wired network connection and your computer lacks an Ethernet port but has a USB port, this does the job perfectly. On my Windows 7 it was a quick install and it did not interfere with my Wi-Fi or my other Ethernet port. According to the specs, you get 10/100 Mbit/s 10BasteT/10BAseTx both full duplex and half duplex. Gigabit Ethernet, of course, is only possible over USB 3.0 because USB 2.0 is limited to about 480 Mbit/s so it's not supported by this specific model.It's an easy 5-stars because I am unaware of any defects.","[1, 1]",Limited by USB 2.0 bandwidth but otherwise as expected,2014,05, 18,1.0,707,127,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20140518

The on/off switch on a USB hub may seem odd or unneeded but I actually have good uses for it because my keyboard won't be recognized when I drop my laptop into the docking station unless I do a power recycle so, rather than plug/unplug a cable to turn off the power for 'everything' I simply switch the hub on/off and it's more convenient. This can also be handy if you are using more than one input device such as mice and keyboards or you want to explicitly shut off access to certain peripherals.Based on my testing, the hub appears to be reliable and well made. Its small size makes it great to take it along while traveling but, again, all the power it gets it draws from your laptop so don't expect to hang HDDs off it.","[1, 1]",Turn-me-off (or on) convenience,2014,05, 18,1.0,1151,213,Positive,1,1,0,0.022439342126689465,20140518

It's all done in less than 5 minutes but you need good eyes and a steady hand because the little screws are VERY small.The HDD, once in the enclosure, connects to the computer via a (provided) USB 3.0 wire which powers it. It's immediately recognized by Windows 7 or 8 or your PS3 and you are ready to use it. Recommended.End of short story.SPECSYou get the following:- The aluminum enclosure with the circuitry to the USB interface. It's important for the case to be 'metal' because metal helps dissipate the heat, unlike 'plastic' which would trap it inside.- 4 little screws (them being so small, it would be good to have an extra just in case).- A screwdriver for the little screws.- A nice USB 3.0 interface cable.- Some low-grade plastic-rubber or rubberized plastic protective sleeve which you are not likely to use.- A little English/Spanish/French manual that includes the an easy to follow 5-step installation guide.RATINGI like it because the price is right and it meets my expectations of keeping HDDs I rip off old laptops or gaming machines safe and accessible through a fast interface.","[0, 0]",Thing of beauty and good protection,2014,05, 18,,1242,206,Positive,0,0,0,0.022406774141019378,20140518

Of course, they never hinted that a positive review as expected in return.The point of the attached imperfect video (sorry, had to take off for our vacation so I could only afford one take) should, I hope, help those interested decide which of the leading 'big sound' portable speakers they'd prefer, the 'competition' beingBose SoundLink Bluetooth Speaker III. Speaking for myself, while both are 'good', I found the Blaster's sound a lot more organic, so to speak. It's louder and more powerful too even on this recording, made with its 'roar' enhancement off.I hope the first part of the video puts to rest the charge advanced by some professional reviewer that the Roar bass is weak. It's not. But I'm not going to say words. Just listen and decide.Now, for what the video's image and sound don't show and still in a Blaster vs. Bose comparison mode, the Roar is smaller and lighter which is a good thing given that its sound is fuller and louder. It also lays down flat vs. Bose's stand up operating mode so the Blaster is more stable. The Blaster seems to be selling for a better price at the time I'm writing this.It also comes with lots of features, and I'm sure I'm going to miss some of them:- Long battery life: should last for about 8 hours, according to specs.- Charges either off its proprietary solution or, slowly, off a computer through the USB port.- Bluetooth: of course. The video was playing off a Bluetooth pairing with a Chromebook playing Pandora. It supports various pairing modes, including one that would allow TWO phones.- Phone support, no surprise there, with most functions implemented through tapping one button.- NFC (Near Field Communication): if your phone has it, you can play stuff off your phone by simply placing it near the Blaster.- Voice recorder: yes, it does that. The built-in mic will capture your voice and record it to a MicroSD card.- MicroSD playback: allows random play (my favorite) or sequential with the ability to skip to the next song or folder/album- Panic alarm: don't know who will ever think of pushing the panic alarm button on the Blaster rather than screaming 'Help' in a panic situation but... well... it's there.- Charger mode: believe it or not, you can use the Blaster to charge your phone through a USB portLike I said, I suspect I might have missed a feature or 2 but, in the end, what really counts in an external speaker is sound quality, portability, ease of operation and price and on all of the above Blaster's Roar is outstanding.Oh, of course, I forgot to mention the Roar button. It's what you use if you want to expand the sound to 'fill the room'. It works and it does seem to spread the sound around.P.S. My review mentions an attached video. I am attaching one but my experience with Amazon is that it sometimes takes them a day or 2 to post the video part so, please check later if the video is not there when you are reading this.","[2, 4]",Creative's Blaster Roar vs. Bose's Soundlink III,2014,07, 5,0.5,2973,528,Positive,2,4,2,0.022406774141019378,20140705
